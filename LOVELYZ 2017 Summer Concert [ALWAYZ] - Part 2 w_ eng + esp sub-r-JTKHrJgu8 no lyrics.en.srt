00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,040
- Hello!
- Peek-a-boo!

2
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,840
- LOVELINUS!
- Hello!

3
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,840
Nice to meet you.

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,760

5
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,060

6
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,300

7
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,740

8
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,780

9
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,850

10
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,120

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,030

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,560

13
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,900

14
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,770

15
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,880

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,650

17
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,570

18
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,650

19
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,490

20
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,630

21
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,670

22
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,770

23
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,510

24
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,380

25
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,920

26
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,790

27
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,900

28
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,370

29
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,240

30
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,780

31
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,650

32
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,690

33
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,620

34
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,730

35
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,640

37
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,510

38
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,580

39
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,610

40
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,820

41
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,760

42
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,860

43
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,000

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,900

45
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,540

46
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,610

47
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,510

48
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,720

49
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,890

50
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,200
Ah, we...

51
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,030
Performed 'Candy Jelly Love' differently from yesterday.

52
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,900
'Candy Jelly Love'...

53
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,210
Singing 'Candy Jelly love' again...

54
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,040
Makes me feel we must start over the concert.
It feels like it's the opening again.

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,610
Let's do it again,let's do it again.

56
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,880
- Shall we do it again?
- Shall we?

57
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,310
- I wan to do it again.
- Shall we?

58
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,020
We did an encore song and then it's really over.

59
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,160
We are going to talk about our thoughts o being with LOVELINUS at a big concert all. One by one.

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,300
- Starting from YeIn today,
- Yes, from the youngest member.

61
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,860
Red beans...

62
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,430
I will try hard to become Red beans.

63
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,330
Everyone, it's really the last moment of today's ALWAYZ concert.

64
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,570
How can this happen?

65
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,340
I can't believe this...

66
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,110
Being first is more pressuring than I thought,

67
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,750
I don't know what I should say first.

68
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,320
First of all, thank you so much for filling up our second concert too.

69
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,060
But I won't cry.

70
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,830
I didn't cry yesterday.

71
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,870
I'm not crying, I'm not crying.

72
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,070
I won't cry today.

73
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,680
I kept saying thank you so much yesterday,

74
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:35,490
so I don't want to end my ment by keep saying thank you again.

75
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,360
This is what I thought.

76
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,800
The time we didn't perform on stage after 'Now, We',

77
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:52,300
it made me imagine that one day we will become grandmothers.

78
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,550
And when time passes, I might not be able

79
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,450
to sing in front of LOVELINUS or other people.

80
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,260
So this moment is so overwhelming and very honoring.

81
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,860
The two days were so valuable and happy.

82
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,910
That made me think that I was born to do this.

83
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,880
And there are many people who make a difficult debut through TV programs.

84
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,320
They make me think about lots of things.

85
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:52,900
LOVELINUS, you are such a happiness that make me forget all the hardships.

86
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,200
So don't go anywhere and stay by my side even tough I'm not perfect.

87
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,510
Working with these cool members and staffs,

88
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:10,280
and meeting LOVELINUS is such a blessing in my life.

89
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,490
And these days are totally unforgettable.

90
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,360
Actually,

91
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,090
when I first started LOVELYZ,

92
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,730
I thought a lot about 'Who would like me?'

93
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,540
Because I didn't have anything.

94
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,110
Umh, so...

95
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,980
Thank you.

96
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,150
Thank you.

97
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,820
So actually this...

98
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,160
The moment I'm standing here

99
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,400
feels like a dream.

100
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,300
And I'll call our pink lightstick the 'Lovebong'.

101
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,540
This lightstick...

102
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,710
Being waved makes this place look like it's real night and you look like stars.

103
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,310
Because every one of you is shinning so much.

104
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,720
Everyone, let's glitter and shine each other. Even in the future, just like we do now.

105
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,120
That's how I want us to be together. And...

106
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,530
Thank you to my parents who came to the concert for two days in a row.

107
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,870
I wish my grandmother's and my aunt's health

108
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,800
I want everyone to be healthy.

109
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,140
I want everyone here to be healthy.

110
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,570
Thank you to my friends too.

111
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,580
I didn't say it before bu thank you Young Jun for being here.

112
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,980
But he ones who watch me from far

113
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,950
and lead me whenever I am depressed or in trouble,

114
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,830
and the ones whom I am most grateful is you who are here now.

115
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,170
I really, really, think a lot about you.

116
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,110
So don't go anywhere else and I want to be with you forever. I love you so much.

117
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,350
Ah, thank you.

118
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,090
LOVELYZ's ALWAYZ concert

119
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,830
which we have been waiting for so long is finally happily and joyfully over now.

120
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:47,510
While preparing for the concert, I thought and felt many things,

121
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:00,150
but first of all, thank you to our CEO who helps us to be able to perform on stages every time.

122
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,160
And I want to thank you LOVELINUS for being the reason of our stage.

123
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,800
There are our lacking parts when we practice.

124
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,440
We are worried about what we should do with those problems,

125
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,240
but when we come up on stage,

126
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,850
LOVELINUS helps us not think about it anymore.

127
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,490
And you are the ones who make us believe that we are doing so well.

128
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,560
So thank you for giving us energy on stage

129
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,030
and giving us the reason to be powerful.

130
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,830
Just like YeIn said, you are really like stars.

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,370
I've said this before at the last concert.

132
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,680
When the lights go out, you wave the lovebongs just like now,

133
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,180
and everytime you do, I'm so happy as if I'm dreaming.

134
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,320
I am so proud.

135
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,630
We will try hard to become proud singers,

136
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,360
so will you cheer for us forever?

137
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,900
YES!!

138
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,900
Thank you so much.

139
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,540
Thank you so much for filling up the seats.

140
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,940
And I wish we could be together for the next and the upcoming concerts and enjoy together.

141
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,980
Yes, LOVELINUS, thank you so much.

142
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,460
I made a tongueslip to you yesterday.

143
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,870
I said I didn't have friends.

144
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,140
I said I didn't have friends.

145
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,210
What I was trying to say wasn't that.

146
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,040
I was...

147
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,010
trying to express the loneliness of my heart.

148
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,480
But I think I said it in a wrong way.

149
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,620
I invited my friends. I invited 20 friends yesterday,

150
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,520
and 20 friends again today. So I'm the 1st among the members.

151
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,060
But...

152
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,800
You are my friends too.

153
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,670
So I hope you aren't upset about it.

154
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:38,240
And thank you to our CEO who helped us stand here.

155
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,580
Chairman Hunseok, chairman YoungJun,

156
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,350
vice-president JiYoung, and all the Woollim staffs, thank you,

157
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,620
Ah, I almost forgot. Thank you SeHee.

158
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Since LOVELINUS exists,

159
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,130
I exist too.

160
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,970
I know it's obvious,

161
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,070
but I think my true heart is all said.

162
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,780
Even at the last concert too!

163
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,210
So I really...

164
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:23,720
There are so many things that I still haven't shown to LOVELINUS yet.

165
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,260
But I have more days to live, don't I?

166
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,330
And you do too.

167
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,570
I will be a singer until the day I live.

168
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,230
LOVELYZ, we will be always together!

169
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,200
LOVELINUS, you'll always be LOVELINUS too.

170
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,610
I won't speed up during the time given.

171
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm going to take it slow,

172
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:53,220
so I'll be to LOVELINUS, th JIN who slowly improves, and...

173
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you to my parents who cheer me,

174
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,390
cheer me,

175
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,230
pray for me, and praise me for doing well.

176
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,840
Thank you to my parents and my sister JooEun.

177
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,280
I won't cry. I am really strong now.

178
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,980
I got really strong during this summer so I won't cry.

179
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,680
I always said...

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,520
that I'll be strong and

181
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,430
said 'I'm older than you' to the younger members,

182
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,560
but I think I was a kid until now.

183
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,000
So starting from today,

184
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,000
I know it's too late, but from today,

185
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,710
I will be a strong elder sister.

186
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,950
I want LOVELINUS to watch that.

187
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,120
What?

188
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,850
Fighting!

189
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,050
Thank you so much until now.

190
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,090
As a member of LOVELYZ,

191
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,030
as JIN, the singer,

192
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,530
and as a person Park MyungEun,

193
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,500
I will try to become a good person, a right person.

194
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,300
Watch me. Thank you.

195
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,760
I wanted to thank everyone who came to the concert.

196
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,460
Thank you.

197
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,900
I got more confident trough yesterday's concert.

198
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,680
So today, I really threw myself to the stage.

199
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,880
So I enjoyed it so much and I was really happy.

200
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,020
Because of you, the stages were so happy.

201
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:14,320
And I thank LOVELINUS for making me to improve everyday.

202
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,570
I will try to give you bigger energy and a brighter energy.

203
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,570
Everyone, thank you so much.

204
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,840
Yes?

205
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,940
Thank you.

206
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,110
And Woollim staff.

207
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:41,850
When we prepare for our concert, the whole company gets so busy.

208
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,020
All of you must be tired, and you did a great job.

209
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,990
Thank you so much for taking care of us.

210
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,660
And...

211
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:59,540
our CEO who is sometimes friendly but sometimes difficult.

212
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,840
When we are having a hard time.

213
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,410
Lee Joon Yeop! Lee Joon Yeop! Lee Joon Yeop!

214
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,750
God-Joon Yeop.

215
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,920
Everytime we are having a hard time, he supports us.

216
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,090
and thank you for giving us the courage, CEO.

217
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,370
We could be on this stage because of you, I love you.

218
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,870
I love all the Woollim staffs,

219
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:40,310
and the band, and other staffs, you've done a great job today.

220
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you so much.

221
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,380
Today is a really special day.

222
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,520
My family is here.

223
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,330
They are cheering me over there.

224
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,800
Mom, they are thanking you!

225
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,070
When I was young and I just vaguely said 'Mom, I want to be a singer',

226
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,610
when I just said 'I want to be a singer',

227
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,280
She just...

228
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,810
didn't disagree at all and kept supporting me

229
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,180
and cheering me.

230
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,620
So I think...

231
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,290
I am at this place because of my parents.

232
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,890
I love my family so much.

233
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:38,870
I will also become a star that only shines for LOVELINUS.

234
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,670
LOVELINUS should

235
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:43,240
always, always, always

236
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,870
look at

237
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,940
LOVELYZ only.

238
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,850
YES!!!

239
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,080
Thank you, I love you.

240
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,460
I won't cry today.

241
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,200
Thank you for coming to our concert for two days in a row.

242
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,040
I lost track of what I said yesterday because I was crying,

243
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,750
and so I won't cry today in order to thank you properly.

244
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,280
Yesterday...

245
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,260
I saw the video of me talking.

246
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,160
And I thought 'How stupid can I be?'

247
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,930
I kept saying I'm going to be mature,

248
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,170
but watching me talking makes me think I was so stupid.

249
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,100
I kept crying and couldn't even talk properly.

250
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,940
So today I will...

251
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,840
Ah, what?

252
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,080
Thank you.

253
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,110
What?

254
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,210
Was I cute?

255
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:06,860
First of all, the glittering stars! are the ones who made us able to dance and sing on the stage.

256
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,230
Thank you so much.

257
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:17,670
LOVELINUS are the one who solve the problem when LOVELYZ has one.

258
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,910
So when you have problems, talk to us.

259
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,740
We have a show about troubles.

260
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,150
And we are always open.

261
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:33,620
We are always open,

262
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,090
so come to us, okay?

263
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,060
Thank you so much for shining like this all the time, LOVELINUS.

264
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,870
The amazing thing is how could we think about the same thing?

265
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,500
SuJeong and YeIn.

266
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,400
Stars, you are really like stars.

267
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
You really shine.

268
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,610
I felt at the first concert.

269
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,640
- Lightsticks! Pink stars.
- Stars.

270
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,420
Thank you very much for completing the two days of ALWAYZ concert.

271
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,750
And thank you to the band who must have had a hard time,

272
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,990
and thank you to all the Woollim staffs.

273
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,930
Please take care of LOVELYZ in the future too.

274
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,370
Yes, I didn't cry today.

275
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Well done!

276
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Pat, pat, pat.

277
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,650
Yes, it's me.

278
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,290
They said everything before me, so I don't know what to say.

279
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,090
But I'll say what pops up in my head.

280
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,660
More fans are here today than yesterday.

281
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,770
Thank you for enjoying it energetically with us.

282
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,540
And because of you, our performances got complete.

283
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,480
In the future, I would like to enjoy stages with you

284
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,420
at a bigger stage.

285
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,320
I'm grateful to all the staffs, but they already said it.

286
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,590
So I won't do it.

287
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:27,030
But I hope you will know that I'm thankful.

288
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,170
Um, and...

289
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,530
What?

290
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,570
Firm. Yes, I am firm.

291
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,280
And my family is here too.

292
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,620
My mother came to the 'LOVELYZ in Winterland' too.

293
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,590
At 'LOVELYZ in Winterland', when I was doing to closing ment,

294
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,490
I didn't talk about my family. I was out of my mind and I forgot.

295
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,660
My mom came to me and said

296
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,870
'Why didn't you talk about me when the other members talked about their family'

297
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,340
'I'm so upset'. So this time I'm going to say it.

298
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,670
But mom... mom, thank you...

299
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,710
for giving birth to me.

300
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,510
The reason I could be a singer was

301
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:21,480
Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry!

302
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,890
Thank you.

303
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,790
She said thank you.

304
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,330
The reason I could be a singer was...

305
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,930
My mom and my family...

306
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,840
Don't cry, you fool.

307
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,380
I think it was because I had a family.

308
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,890
It's not like I didn't want to say it

309
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,520
I forgot.

310
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,970
It's alright! It's alright! It's alright!

311
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,970
I want to thank my mom,

312
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,470
my sister and my family.

313
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,880
We have three cats at home, and I thank them too.

314
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,050
But the most grateful ones are you, LOVELINUS.

315
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,380
I'm not good at expressing,

316
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,020
but I'm grateful. So grateful.

317
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,250
What I felt during the concert was that

318
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,760
we do not want to die while we live,

319
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,330
but we die anyway.

320
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:15,270
Who would experience this while we live?

321
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,640
There aren't many people who can perform in front of many people.

322
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,710
I feel so grateful,

323
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,080
and I think it's such a valuable experience.

324
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,410
Let's make more good memories.

325
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:35,420
And I stop LOVELYZ members talking and emcee al the time,

326
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,090
but thank you

327
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,760
and I want to say that I love you all.

328
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,990
It's your turn.

329
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,030
Well.

330
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,380
Well, as previously mentioned, Woollim Family,

331
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,420
the staffs, the band, and Big Picture Performance team.

332
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,150
Thank you so much once again.

333
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,590
But LOVELINUS is who I thank the most.

334
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,930
Well just... I always think of

335
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,030
the last comment...

336
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,400
but I don't know what to say.

337
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,070
Because I always thank you.

338
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,420
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry!

339
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,290
I always feel like I want to say that I love you,

340
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:49,190
and saying only good things, but they are too short.

341
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,460
They are short, so...

342
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,570
Everytime before I stand on stage...

343
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,370
this is what I think.

344
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,210
I'm...

345
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,240
nothing...

346
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,940
and nobody...

347
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,830
But the love you constantly give me

348
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,600
and cheer for me...

349
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,270
is just too much for me.

350
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,610
To you...

351
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,210
When you give us 100,

352
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,580
I want to give you 200, 300 and more.

353
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,220
But I'm always so sorry that I'm lacking of everything.

354
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,930
Really...

355
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,630
I want to say thank you and I love you for supporting me.

356
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,010
And filling up this place.

357
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,780
My mom and sister are here too.

358
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,490
But the 'LOVELYZ in Winterland'

359
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,190
Those who came to the winter concert will know

360
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,330
that I said I don't cry in front of my family.

361
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,530
I did...

362
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,900
But today,

363
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,040
I cried because there were so many things to be sorry and thankful to all of you.

364
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,540
I will be better for you,

365
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,520
and be the JiSoo who can return more than I receive.

366
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,590
So let's please meet for a long time.

367
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,560
Yes!!!

368
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,660
I love you.

369
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
Yes, it's my turn~

370
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,480
All the members cried before me.

371
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,920
Oh no!

372
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,790
Well, my parents also came here today.

373
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,590
The piano sounds so great.

374
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,590
When I was singing 'Candy Jelly Love' as the encore song,

375
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,770
I was eye contacting with the fans, and saw my mother all of sudden...

376
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,340
like 'boom'. And so I said 'hi' and went.

377
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,640
I saw her.

378
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,380
My heart was beating like boom!

379
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,410
But at that time,

380
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,850
Since 'Candy Jelly Love' was an encore song for LOVELINUS...

381
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,060
so I focused more for LOVELINUS.

382
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,130
But thank you to my parents for coming,

383
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,230
thank you for supporting all the time.

384
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:20,970
And for the first time, my high school friends are here at the concert.

385
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,410
Thank you so much for coming.

386
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,180
Okcheon, Okcheon, Okcheon.

387
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,920
Yes! Okcheon... Okcheon is good!

388
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,050
Yes, thank you for coming.

389
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:46,630
And thank you so much for sweating while waiting outside in the heat for our concert.

390
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,800
And since today is the last concert, I feel so sad.

391
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,670
And I feel like I must do it again tomorrow.

392
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,780
Shall we do it again tomorrow?

393
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,280
Well, then.

394
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,050
At 5 pm!

395
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,750
At 5pm?

396
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,580
I want to.

397
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,360
The fact that I became a singer

398
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,230
shouldn't feel like a dream but it still does.

399
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,590
Sometimes it really

400
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,900
feels like a dream.

401
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,230
So I am very scared that I'll go back to reality when I wake up.

402
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,810
But since I have you, LOVELINUS.

403
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,010
You give me the power, and as I said before,

404
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,950
you shine very much.

405
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,080
Wherever you go, 'Oh, you shine!'

406
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,690
Really...

407
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,330
want to see eacho of you with my eyes,

408
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,170
but...

409
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,240
my eyes aren't following me.

410
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,810
I want to see all of you.

411
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,310
I won't cry.

412
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,250
Thank you so much for coming despite this heat.

413
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,890
Your throats are sore from cheering on such a hot day, right?

414
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,220
We are fine!!

415
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,190
Please, don't say you are fine.

416
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,750
Please, don't say you are fine.

417
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,820
You are not fine.
You always go back with sore throats.

418
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
And how you can say you are fine?

419
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,190
I know that you aren't.

420
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,230
I shouldn't cry.

421
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,040
But seeing you wave the lovebong so hard.

422
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,780
I know... you are having a hard time.

423
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,710
You are pretty!

424
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,650
Thank you... I look ugly, don't I?

425
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,090
I should look pretty.

426
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,130
It fell down.

427
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,360
MIJOO IS THE PRETTIEST!!!

428
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,070
Thank you, go back home and turn on the air conditioner when you sleep.

429
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,710
Remember to take a shower today.

430
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,410
Those who got wet.

431
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,180
You can smell of sweat because it's hot.

432
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,420
Go home and wash yourself and your clothes.

433
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,920
And dream of LOVELYZ at home.

434
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,930
We will dream of LOVELINUS too.

435
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,330
Thank you for...

436
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,330
cheering up for us like this.

437
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,140
And I hope that we always stay together.

438
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,970
This will not change, same as always.

439
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,140
I look ugly.

440
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,680
I wish that we will always be together.

441
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,150
I love you LOVELINUS,

442
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,290
my parents and CEO Joong Yeop.

443
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,620
I love JiYoung,

444
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,420
I love LOVELINUS,

445
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,890
I love my high school friends,

446
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,430
and I love LOVELYZ.

447
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,760
- Me too!
- We love you too!

448
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,460
Me too.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,070
I love you.

450
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,140
There's something I didn't say.

451
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,100
What is it?

452
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,310
My parents are here too. Even my grandmother.

453
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,980
Today...

455
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,790
Hello!

456
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,390
Hello.

457
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,390
I invited my friends for the first time too.

458
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm sorry, my parents are here too...

459
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,530
I love my parents.

460
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,110
And Nini, who always adores me, thank you too.

461
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,280
And there's more things we did'nt say.

462
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,480
We are performing

463
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,450
- ALWAYZ in Japan next week.
- That's right.

464
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,720
Will you support us a lot?

465
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,830
I knew it, LOVELINUS,

466
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,630
- Thank you.
- We will come back safe from Japan.

467
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,400
Then we will end the concert with our final song.

468
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
We will sing our next song.

469
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,410
- Bye~
- See you again next time.

470
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,840

471
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:38,980

472
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,890

473
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,660

474
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,430

475
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:01,500

476
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,710

477
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,710

478
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,680

479
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,580

480
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,520

481
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,860

482
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:28,330

483
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,450

484
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:49,620

485
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,620

486
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620

487
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,830

488
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,900

489
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,800

490
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,870

491
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:15,640

492
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,050

493
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:27,960

494
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:35,000

495
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,500

496
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,570

497
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,970

498
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,550

499
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,850

500
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:02,090

501
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,690

502
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,700

503
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,640

504
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,910

505
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,650

506
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,780

507
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,350
Good bye. Good bye.
