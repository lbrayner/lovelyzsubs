We'll do our best today.

4
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:18,316
- Whether it's here...
- Or there...

5
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,552
In the end... Weekly Idol!

6
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:24,382
The Thumbs Up Idol of the Week

7
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,266
have amazing credentials.

8
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:31,434
They've done 260 concerts.

9
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,152
They're amazing rookies.

10
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:38,148
Thumbs Up Idol of the Week. IN2IT!

11
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,466
They're flying in.

12
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,763
They look great.

13
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,379
Is this "Gee?"

14
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,583
Goodness.

15
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:04,188
("Gee" 2x version)

16
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,526
(Can they express the sentiment
of girls in love?)

17
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:11,116
(Let's go, IN2IT)

18
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,046
(IN2IT is making me tremble)

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,749
(IN2IT is making me tremble)

20
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,205
(Cute / Adorable)

21
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,288
(They're so dreamy)

22
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,732
(IN2IT is making me tremble)

23
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:27,672
(So much for getting any sleep tonight...)

24
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,312
(Let's do the killer part)

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,256
(It's like it's IN2IT's song)

26
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,704
(So cute)

27
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:48,079
(This is perfection)

28
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,967
They're going right into the next one.

29
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,160
This is their new song.

30
00:01:57,892 --> 00:01:59,068
"SnapShot."

31
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,571
("SnapShot" 2x version)

32
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,405
(They suddenly get manly...)

33
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,675
(Thank you so much... Sigh)

34
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,443
(Why does this look a bit silly?)

35
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:14,094
(So amazing)

36
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:15,723
(Make everyone possessed)

37
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,255
(Time for some fast dancing)

38
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,788
(Taking snapshots)

39
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,355
(They have to keep moving
their upper bodies)

40
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,851
(We're falling for them, they're so good)

41
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,939
(We have to remember something so amazing)

42
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:46,147
(Be responsible for my heart beat)

43
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:52,723
(Power walking)

44
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:57,754
IN2IT!

45
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:58,714
Amazing.

46
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:01,553
Thumbs Up Idol of the Week! IN2IT!

47
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,045
You guys were amazing.

48
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:07,319
Catch your breath first
and greet the people.

49
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,813
We'll greet everyone.

50
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,445
Come on! Hello, we're IN2IT!
Please be good to us!

51
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,193
Thumbs Up Idol of the Week. IN2IT.

52
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:16,489
"SnapShot."

53
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,848
You keep taking photos
during the dance.

54
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,393
And you pose like models too.

55
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,970
The song sounds great even at 2x.

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,153
Thank you.

57
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:26,680
I was so impressed.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,246
They're supposed to get 3 seconds to talk
about song but I'll give them 5 seconds.

59
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,349
(Unexpected good news)

60
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,966
We'll give you 5 seconds to
tell us about "SnapShot."

61
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,686
Go ahead!

62
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,749
With Madonna's song "Vogue" from 1990
as the theme,

63
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,400
it's a song that makes you think of
models on the runway!

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,257
(He did it in 5 seconds!)

65
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:48,207
He even had time left.

66
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,198
(Such good pronunciation)

67
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,474
You know "Vogue" by Madonna?

68
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,410
Yes.

69
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,174
The dance goes like this.

70
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,747
Now it's time to move on.

71
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,153
Let's do the Charm Mining Cam.

72
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:03,195
Come on, Director Yoo.

73
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:04,541
Director Yoo's Charm Mining Cam.

74
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,257
Get some epic clips.

75
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,386
(Director Yoo's Charm Mining Cam)

76
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:11,438
As Director Yoo approaches you,

77
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,276
show off all your skills and talents.

78
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,916
In Ho.

79
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,228
This is what I prepared.

80
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,661
Jang Do Yeon's high fashion model pose.

81
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,829
I'll give it a shot.

82
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,764
Director Yoo, follow me.

83
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,309
Hurry and follow him.

84
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,937
(This should be an amazing clip)

85
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,534
One. Click.

86
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,400
(Nice detail)

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,259
Two. Click.

88
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,447
(Bending)

89
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,171
Three. Click.

90
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,051
Four...

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,138
(I'm In Ho of IN2IT)

92
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,359
This pose was funny.

93
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,927
Do Yeon, are you watching this?

94
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,175
You should do model poses with me one day.

95
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,767
(He even sent a message to Jang Do Yeon)

96
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,407
Nice.

97
00:04:56,407 --> 00:04:58,849
Who are you going to next, Director Yoo?

98
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,141
- It's Director Yoo.
- In Pyo?

99
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,780
His lips are really dry! Isaac!

100
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,941
(When did he see that?)

101
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:07,748
Isaac! His lips look dried out.

102
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:11,857
I'll do a cover of Celeb Five's song.

103
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:13,431
(Really?)

104
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:15,514
- A cover.
- Really?

105
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:18,323
- A dance cover.
- A dance cover?

106
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,334
Okay. I'm dancing with you.

107
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,978
(Isaac is touched)

108
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:29,047
("Celeb Five" by Celeb Five)

109
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:29,950
(Looking great)

110
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,322
He's making the right face!

111
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:34,959
(So into it)

112
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:38,039
(Nobody can stop Isaac)

113
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,723
(This is more exciting than
the original version)

114
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,494
(So exciting)

115
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,428
(Isaac is so excited!)

116
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,630
He's into it.

117
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,466
(Going into 2x speed)

118
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,729
I knew this would happen.

119
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,141
(A tough dance)

120
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,086
(Hang in there, Isaac)

121
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:03,022
(Aaah)

122
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:03,969
(Aaah)

123
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:06,946
(So funny)

124
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,506
(Chaotic dancing)

125
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,210
(Isaac showed off his skills)

126
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,393
(Huffing)

127
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,492
(Didn't expect 2x speed, did you?)

128
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,920
He looked so determined.

129
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,210
That was great.

130
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,824
2x! What was that?

131
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,497
This show isn't that easy.

132
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,152
Alright, we saw Isaac.

133
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,593
Next is In Pyo.

134
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:32,615
Hello, I'm the super sexy leader, In Pyo.

135
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:33,944
I'll show you all

136
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:37,564
a dance cover for Sun Mi's "Gashina."

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,421
(In Pyo will dance to "Gashina?")

138
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,706
(How will he pull this off?)

139
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,802
("Gashina" by Sun Mi)

140
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:51,741
(Sexy, flexible and on point)

141
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,434
Such pretty lines.

142
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,846
(His sexy moves look so precise)

143
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:00,835
He dances like J-black.

144
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,379
(He's supposed to be sexy and cute
but he's so dreamy)

145
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,939
Look into Director Yoo's camera.

146
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,378
Director Yoo, move up more.

147
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,715
(Director Yoo works hard to
make an epic clip)

148
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:20,567
Get closer, Director Yoo.

149
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,594
I don't want to.

150
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,311
I'll just move from here.

151
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,055
(This is already epic)

152
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,983
(Everyone cheers)

153
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:45,269
Go!

154
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,709
That's it!

155
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,593
(Shaking the camera)

156
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,601
(All over the place)

157
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:55,242
Here comes Director Yoo!

158
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:01,267
(Great job, In Pyo)

159
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:02,664
We saw the real Director Yoo.

160
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,647
I got a good shot there.

161
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,095
(I gave it my all...)

162
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,863
Director Yoo's Charm Mining Cam.

163
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,943
This has been the handsome
and talented group IN2IT.

164
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:14,600
You guys have any closing words?

165
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,375
We still have so much more
to show you all.

166
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,424
So I hope you all can support us.

167
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:22,135
Please try to look for us
and show us some love.

168
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,967
Please be good to us.

169
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,367
And we'll continue to try harder.

170

Please look out for us!

171
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,623
Thank you.

172
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,571
This has been IN2IT!

173
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,519
It's the Idol of the Week.

174
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,783
No need to introduce them.
Let's just bring them in.

175
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,527
You seem so happy.

176
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,792
It's been so long since
I've seen them.

177
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,719
What are you talking about?

178
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,872
These people...

179
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:51,967
Who are they?
You're so happy.

180
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,719
I feel different.

181
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,191
You feel different?

182
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,359
I feel embarrassed.

183
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,105
- Your ears are red.
- I don't know...

184
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,671
- Why?
- I don't know!

185
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,533
What's wrong with you both?

186
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,989
Bring them in now.

187
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:07,182
Idol of the Week!

188
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,793
Lovelyz!

189
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,385
Hello.

190
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,913
(They come in like a spring breeze!)

191
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:21,308
(Ye In)

192
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:22,285
(Ji Ae)

193
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,365
(Su Jeong)

194
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,437
(Mi Joo)

195
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:25,540
(Baby Soul)

196
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,705
(Ji Soo)

197
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,247
(The group that spreads love, Lovelyz)

198
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:32,758
Hello, we're Lovelyz.

199
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,439
You haven't been on our show in a year.

200
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,094
And when you were here last year
you had another year-long absence.

201
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:42,511
Is it Yearly Idol for you girls?

202
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,911
Yearly Idol...

203
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:46,726
Lovelyz came out with a new song.

204
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,871
Tell us about "That Day."

205
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,214
Who's going to talk?

206
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,435
- About the song.
- Mi Joo.

207
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,647
I've never seen a female idol do this.

208
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:01,199
"Tell us about your song."
They usually do this.

209
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,499
But Mi Joo went...

210
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:06,141
She called out to me with her chin.

211
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,610
(Earlier)

212
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:13,013
(How did she see that?)

213
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,365
You do it.

214
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,478
Who?

215
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:19,016
You do it!

216
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:21,452
So funny.

217
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:23,574
- I'll talk.
- JIN.

218
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,797
It's a therapeutic song.

219
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,094
What's our concept?

220
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,949
Clear and cool.

221
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:33,502
We're so refreshing in our music video.

222
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,444
You'll all fall for us.

223
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:39,771
Please listen to our song
when you're sick.

224
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:42,116
- When we're sick?
- It'll cure you.

225
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,448
Really?

226
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:48,545
Even our dance has some
moves that cure you.

227
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:51,315
- In the beginning...
- Right?

228
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,026
(Blow)

229
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,531
This makes you feel better?

230
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,242
It blows your pain away.

231
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,794
- Hoo, I'll cure you.
- Of all illnesses?

232
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:02,724
("That Day" by Lovelyz)

233
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,763
(Clear and cool)

234
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,860
(Lovelyz will cure all my scars)

235
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,130
(It's time to be cured by Lovelyz!)

236
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,140
(At the tip of my nose, hwa)

237
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,153
(In my mouth, hoo)

238
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:19,588
(The dance is so catchy)

239
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,185
They cure you.

240
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:25,297
(They're so sweet, chic and bubbly)

241
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:28,030
(Cold memories, hwa)

242
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,170
(Collect everything, hoo)

243
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:40,345
(My body feels cured from hardships)

244
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,667
(All cured)

245
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:47,005
(Clapping)

246
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:47,765
Lovelyz...

247
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,974
You guys were floating around
so lightly like feathers.

248
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:54,366
Lovelyz always sound so lovely.

249
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:58,592
Even people that don't know them
will want to

250
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,247
know them after hearing this song.

251
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,126
They have their own style.

252
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:05,567
Their unique style.

253
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,006
That style is important.

254
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,401
You girls are on our show after a year.

255
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,097
Did you know we came out
with a 2x dance?

256
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,545
I've seen a lot of over groups do that.

257
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,306
Do you want to try it?

258
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:21,481
I thought it would be fun if we tried that.

259
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,945
Will it be perfect?

260
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:25,856
I don't know about that
but it should be fun.

261
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,832
- As long as it's fun.
- That's the best thing.

262
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,898
The song at the original tempo
sounded therapeutic.

263
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,859
It has to be therapeutic at 2x speed
to be perfect.

264
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,259
It has to have that same feeling
which makes this hard.

265
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:42,394
Why does it smell like kimchi stew
now that Lovelyz is here?

266
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,555
Someone must've eaten.

267
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,762
It's for another segment.

268
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:48,330
Is that what it is?

269
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,778
We have to see "That Day."

270
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,755
"Hoo" but it smells like kimchi.

271
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,712
♪ Hoo, kimchi stew, hoo ♪

272
00:12:57,186 --> 00:13:01,496
Shall we see Lovelyz do the 2x dance
to "That Day"?

273
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:02,968
Get in formation.

274
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,737
- This is our first time.
- It's our first time.

275
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,080
- It is?
- Yes.

276
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,012
- You never even practiced this?
- No.

277
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:08,922
Really?

278
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,929
We'll let you hear it first.

279
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,024
This is how fast 2x is.

280
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,196
Cue the music.

281
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,352
(Their minds go blank)

282
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,206
- Oh, no.
- This is too fast.

283
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:23,311
(They start dancing along)

284
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,367
That's very good.

285
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,295
Okay, that's all you get to hear.

286
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,799
I couldn't hear the beat.

287
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,263
While everyone else was shocked

288
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,047
I saw Ji Ae focus on the moves.

289
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,053
(Me?)

290
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,965
(So calm)

291
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,674
I guarantee that Ji Ae
won't make mistakes.

292
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:45,970
Really?

293
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,954
I make the most mistakes.

294
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:49,642
Ji Ae won't make mistakes.

295
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,381
She's the best dancer.

296
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:55,294
Lovelyz will do the 2x dance for
the first time. Cue the music!

297
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,894
Cue the music!

298
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:00,607
("That Day" 2x version)

299
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,255
(Hey! They're good at this!
They're a bunch of liars)

300
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:09,341
(So busy)

301
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:13,213
(How are you girls so precise?)

302
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,134
Don't step on me.

303
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:19,750
(Mi Joo's sensitivity comes out)

304
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,562
She stepped on her.

305
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,137
"Don't step on me."

306
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:25,136
She stepped on me.

307
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,467
(Wobble)

308
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,772
This is doable.

309
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,293
They said it's doable.

310
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,977
(They haven't made a single mistake so far)

311
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:44,861
(So bubbly)

312
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,240
(Hwa)

313
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,227
(Hoo)

314
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:53,783
(They really draw you in)

315
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,396
(Hwa)

316
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,480
(Hoo)

317
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,376
(It's the Lovelyz heart flower)

318
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,239
Is it the entire song?

319
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,452
(Huffing and puffing)

320
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:10,255
(She said it was doable but
seems the most tired)

321
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:14,268
(After almost falling,
Su Jeong looks on point)

322
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:15,735
I think it's the entire song.

323
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,496
(Kei dances at 2x too)

324
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,323
Hey, we're doing well.

325
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,119
(Impressed at themselves...)

326
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,498
(This is so hard)

327
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,434
(They really are doing well)

328
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,083
(Moving into formation)

329
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,295
My arms hurt.

330
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,167
(Tired... Except for Ye In)

331
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,970
(The song is almost over)

332
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:02,057
(A final burst of prettiness!)

333
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,685
(No, don't end!
We want to watch this forever)

334
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:15,888
Look at Ji Ae. No mistakes.

335
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,049
They ran into each other!

336
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,309
But they didn't make mistakes.

337
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:25,556
(Lovelyz succeed at the 2x dance)

338
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:28,944
- That was so fast.
- Their steps were so light there.

339
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:32,524
They were very light on their feet.

340
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,311
We'll give you time to drink some water.

341
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,639
They were good but they had a lot to say.

342
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,592
They kept talking.

343
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:42,160
"You stepped on me."
"That was you."

344
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,529
"We're doing well."

345
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:44,858
"We're doing a good job."

346
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,603
"Did you step on me?"

347
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:48,647
Don't step on me.

348
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,104
You stepped on me.

349
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,400
Hey, we're doing well.

350
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,891
Take it easy for now.

351
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:57,617
Baby Soul's dimples were
visible the entire time.

352
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,937
She kept that same face.

353
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,337
And Ye In is the youngest...

354
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:05,673
"Take it easy for now."

355
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:08,135
This group talks a lot.

356
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,270
They pulled off the 2x speed dance.

357
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,823
They did well so they should
do something else.

358
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,223
(What else?)

359
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:18,191
A new segment we prepared.
The Rollercoaster Dance.

360
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:20,095
You just did the 2x speed
dance for "That Day."

361
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,814
There's a rollercoaster version

362
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,965
that goes super slow, original tempo
and 2x speed.

363
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:28,151
It gets super fast and then super slow.

364
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,527
And you have to stay on beat.

365
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:32,264
(Shows a bad example)

366
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:33,296
Even your lips.

367
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:36,626
Right, even your lips. Lip-synch on beat.

368
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,280
They have a lot of great songs.

369
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,993
So for the first time today...

370
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,853
(What is it?)

371
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:47,223
- The Random Rollercoaster Dance.
- Really?

372
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,475
No!

373
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,563
That should be hard.

374
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:54,803
"That Day" and your hit song "Ah-Choo."

375
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:58,515
We'll combine those two songs
for a Rollercoaster Dance.

376
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,075
They get a big prize if they succeed.

377
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,620
For a cleaner dorm and
better teamwork...

378
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,273
We need that.

379
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:10,175
Sang Min got you a vacuum cleaner.

380
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,438
How many rooms do you have?

381
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:12,983
4 rooms.

382
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:15,927
Sang Min will get you 4 vacuum cleaners!

383
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,503
4.

384
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,462
(Sang Min's wallet is in
trouble every episode)

385
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:22,072
It's cordless? Wow.

386
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:22,992
It's cordless.

387
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:24,916
- You still use one with a cord?
- Yes.

388
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,211
You'll trip over that.

389
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,091
You'll hurt yourself.

390
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,769
(We can't have Lovelyz trip and fall)

391
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:34,034
The Random Rollercoaster Dance.
Please get ready.

392
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:34,858
I'm excited.

393
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,143
You can talk it out first.

394
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:42,547
(They'll do the dance move for
first verse's hook)

395
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:45,787
(Help each other if you don't know)

396
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,444
Let's tell each other.

397
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:50,732
(Act nonchalant if you make a mistake)

398
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,244
They talk the most amongst each other.

399
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,995
They talk a lot.

400
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,188
Mi Joo even has her back
to the cameras.

401
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:02,165
To focus. For real.

402
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:06,018
She's signaling with her chin again.
Okay.

403
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:09,123
I guarantee that Ji Ae
will make no mistakes again.

404
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:10,937
No mistakes from Ji Ae because...

405
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,664
When everyone else was
focused on the meeting

406
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:15,233
she wasn't paying attention...

407
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,727
(This is unrelated to me)

408
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,984
So...

409
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,672
I'm positive. I'm sure.

410
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,121
No mistakes from Ji Ae.

411
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,991
The Rollercoaster Dance!

412
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,021
Cue the music!

413
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:33,836
("That Day" Random Rollercoaster Version)

414
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,772
Like this?

415
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,492
(It's so fast!)

416
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:45,331
(The 3 hosts are focused)

417
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,413
(Ji Ae is already struggling?)

418
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,675
(Nope! She gets right on track)

419
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,663
Ji Ae, we let that slide.

420
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:56,636
(Ye In starts it off)

421
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:02,501
(So pretty)

422
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,583
(Nobody was surprised
when the tempo changed)

423
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,947
(Here come Baby Soul's dimples!)

424
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,939
(It slows down)

425
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,384
(In trouble)

426
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,775
The slow part.

427
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,955
Nice, Jin!

428
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:31,313
(Aaah!)

429
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:34,865
(No! Must stay focused!)

430
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:41,096
Mi Joo!

431
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:44,134
(It seemed so different)

432
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,529
(Mi Joo's hwa and hoo)

433
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:51,193
(Lovelyz is in bloom)

434
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,881
(Light on their feet)

435
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:59,608
(Is this the original tempo? They're so good!)

436
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,434
(Let's change the song)

437
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:10,822
("Ah-Choo" Random Rollercoaster Version)

438
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:12,223
Su Jeong came in acting.

439
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,590
But the song changed.

440
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,634
Mi Joo.

441
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:19,170
(Running after Su Jeong)

442
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,280
My body feels more heavy.

443
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,294
(Now they're ready for "Ah-Choo")

444
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:29,340
(Su Jeong in the center)

445
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:33,795
(Ye In the future chef)

446
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,029
(Kei is so adorable)

447
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,076
(Cute)

448
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,667
(Trips up)

449
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,195
(Acts like it never happened
and looks for the camera)

450
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,420
(Here comes the killer part)

451
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:57,700
(You don't know how I feel, ah-choo)

452
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,653
(Let's see this pretty
and slow part again)

453
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:09,996
(So pretty)

454
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:12,908
(Dancing well)

455
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,403
Her dimples won't go away.

456
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,141
(Cute)

457
00:22:23,112 --> 00:22:25,915
(The beat gets faster)

458
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:28,384
(Save Ji Ae)

459
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:30,337
(Mi Joo and Su Jeong seem fine)

460
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,133
(The 8 girls combine)

461
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,200
(Pauses)

462
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,840
What was that?

463
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,204
Just go for it!

464
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:44,112
(These wily staff members...)

465
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:47,883
(You can't make your mistake so obvious...)

466
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:51,456
- This is making me sneeze!
- You're out!

467
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:53,302
I feel like sneezing.

468
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:54,574
You're out.

469
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,221
- This isn't right.
- Really?

470
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,337
We were right.

471
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,883
Ah-choo. It goes like that.

472
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,787
They had a brief meeting
before doing the move.

473
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:06,019
Ji Ae, do you go in like this?

474
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,880
Is this how you come in?

475
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,908
(Ji Ae seems confused here)

476
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:13,425
Is this part of the dance?

477
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,748
(Please believe me...)

478
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,277
(These two pretend it's the killer part)

479
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,090
Really?

480
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,298
Before you go into the hook

481
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,093
do you have a meeting first
and then start dancing?

482
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,091
We have a brief meeting. 1, 2, 3, "Ah-choo."

483
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:30,314
That's what you do?

484
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:32,694
They had a summit there.

485
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:36,726
(Lovelyz have a summit)

486
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,081
After your meeting and counting to 3,

487
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,810
Ji Ae came out like this.

488
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,938
That was my gesture.

489
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,201
She's the main dancer.

490
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,242
I go like this and walk out.

491
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:51,565
Jin must be honest.

492
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,213
She feels bad about lying.

493
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,934
Jin, what do you say?

494
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,598
It's true.

495
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,482
We don't have a move like this.

496
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,350
(The 3 hosts vs. Lovelyz)

497
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,117
It doesn't exist.

498
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:06,478
No head-scratching move?

499
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,702
Would you like another chance?

500
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,726
But one less vacuum cleaner.
3 in total.

501
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,493
That's fine.

502
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,790
You'll play rock, paper, scissors
for them.

503
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,806
We'll share them.

504
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:19,507
I'll remember this part, Ji Ae.

505
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:22,528
With 3 vacuum cleaners on the line.
Cue the music!

00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,988
Baby Soul.

551
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:22,640
She took a trip somewhere.

552
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,175
(The Lovelyz flowers)

553
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,872
(Almost done! Let's do this)

554
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:37,928
(Hang in there, girls)

555
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:42,384
(Like a row of flowers)

556
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:46,095
(Jin lets you know the song is almost over)

557
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:50,327
(The 8 butterflies get together)

558
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:57,668
(We look so pretty)

559
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:00,080
You guys succeed!

560
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,771
Amazing.

561
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:06,404
You get 3 vacuum cleaners for your dorm!

562
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:08,594
Congratulations.

563
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:10,227
This is great.

564
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,967
Jin was the most serious.

565
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,703
Aside from her mistake...

566
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,607
- From beginning to end...
- She just did her job.

567
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:20,084
She just went her way.

568
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:23,530
- She was staring at the floor.
- Right.

569
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,584
"What should I do after this?"

570
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,944
Time to analyze Lovelyz.

571
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:31,662
Lovelyz Self-Written Reports.

572
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,787
Show Yourself!

573
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:40,463
Let's look at these self-written reports.

574
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:43,247
Baby Soul.

575
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:47,216
Being a good daughter. Mom. Memo.
Comeback. Diet.

576
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:51,303
It's nice to see that she wants
to be a good daughter.

577
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,424
But memo is a lot bigger than mom.

578
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:56,982
Diet is bigger than being a good daughter.

579
00:28:56,982 --> 00:29:00,431
- There's an order.
- Right.

580
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:02,934
Mom is near her mouth.

581
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,673
She keeps saying it. Mom.

582
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:07,313
"Mom! Where are my socks?"

583
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,945
"Mom, I told you to do this for me!"

584
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:13,088
(Baby Soul is a good daughter)

585
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,872
For skills she wrote...

586
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,296
Monster voice.

587
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:20,502
Monster voice. Right.

588
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,899
Can you go do it over there?

589
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,393
Over here?

590
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,601
Into our ears?

591
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,412
This might scare you.

592
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:35,760
(We have no idea what to expect)

593
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,129
Baby Soul has such a pretty voice.

594
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:42,553
Hold on. Why are you behind me?

595
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:45,142
I'm a coward. I'm a scaredy-cat.

596
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:47,242
It's a monster voice.

597
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,139
Hello there.

598
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,093
(Hello there)

599
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,249
(Laughs)

600
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:56,644
So scary!

601
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,745
(Cheerful)

602
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:00,543
How'd you do that?

603
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:04,087
I could make that voice since 1st grade.

604
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:05,584
In elementary school?

605
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,345
I don't know how I do it.

606
00:30:08,345 --> 00:30:09,751
I can just make that voice.

607
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:13,256
You woke up one day
and sounded like that?

608
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:14,791
"I'm going to school now."

609
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,470
You have to block your throat
with your uvula.

610
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,269
Easier said than done.

611
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:25,243
How do you block your throat
with your uvula?

612
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:27,607
She's good.

613
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,344
I bet she can do the crying rap
with that voice tone.

614
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:32,928
Sang Min will demonstrate.

615
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:35,429
It's supposed to come from the stomach.

616
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:39,151
(I was excited about doing this for you)

617
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,279
(Watching the passionate crying rap)

618
00:30:46,522 --> 00:30:47,540
She's going to do this?

619
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,327
Try to sound the same.

620
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:52,771
5, 6, 7, 8.

621
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,787

622
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,682

they can do it?

The crying rap?

626

I think Su Jeong would be good.

627
00:31:06,472 --> 00:31:08,273
Okay. Ready?

628
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:10,342

- Nice.

Ji Soo, you try now.

634
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:26,140

to buy you a gift)

635

636
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:29,876
Mi Joo.

637
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:31,889
- You want me to try?

643

Hold on.

644
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:51,664
We have to protect Mi Joo.

651
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,513
For her skills she wrote...

652
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:15,067
"The monster voice
I learned from Baby Soul."

653
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,242
Why were you hiding it?

654
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:19,418
Why didn't you say something?

655
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,075
You wrote it down.

656
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,859
Let's have them talk to each other.

657
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,920
- With monster voices.
- The monster talk.

658
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,327
Since you were trainees...

659
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,174
Baby Soul.

660
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,658
What?

661
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:35,228
Baby Soul sounds scary.

662
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,785
Thanks for teaching me the monster voice.

663
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:42,083
You have to be louder.

664
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,418

665
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,374

00:32:47,374 --> 00:32:50,602
(She's a good teacher)

667
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:53,578

668
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:56,911
(Can Shin Young do the monster voice?)

669
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:59,107
That was Lee Gye In.

670
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:02,554
(Baby Soul is pretty funny)

671
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:04,543

Her skill...

676
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:17,679
I want to focus on what she crossed out.
"DC."

677
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,383
Despicable cuteness.

678
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:23,436
I crossed that out because I felt
like my fans would get upset.

679
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,774
It's too much to look at.

680
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:26,796
It's too much to look at?

681
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:31,215
That's why I crossed it out.
I shouldn't do this here.

682
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:32,840
But...

683
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,318
- Do you have a new version?
- A new version?

684
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:37,580
Where should I look?

685
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:41,067
Despicable cuteness. 1, 2, 3.

686
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,427
(Sounding so nasally)

687
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:46,962
(We are we embarrassed for her?)

688
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,725
(Nasally)

689
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:55,693
This studio is too cold for Ji Soo.

690
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:58,125
(I can't watch this)

691
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:02,735
So can you hold me?

692
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:05,876
I'd love it if you held me.

693
00:34:06,792 --> 00:34:08,473
Hold on. That was all good but

694
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:11,672
why are you laughing so much,
sound director?

695
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:12,672
(LOL)

696
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,297
I was shocked.

697
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:16,386
I bet your fans would love that.

698
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,873
That was actually very cute.

699
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:22,138
That was adorable.
Can anyone else be despicably cute?

700
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:23,253
Mi Joo.

701
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,406
Mi Joo, let's see.

702
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,567
- Please no!
- Mi Joo.

703
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,473
Hmph! I don't know how to act cute!

704
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:34,601
(She loses her mind!)

705
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:37,308
What? What was that?

706
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,199
She was a despicable monster.

707
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,976
- DM.
- DM.

708
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:47,433
So funny...

709
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:50,069
They were really cute.

710
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,668
They weren't despicable.

711
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:54,398
Ji Soo, you really like rock music.

712
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:56,077
What's your favorite band?

713
00:34:56,077 --> 00:35:00,062
I like the Arctic Monkeys

714
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:01,982
and Blur.

715
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:03,311
Mostly British bands.

716
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,758
Yes, I like British bands.

717
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:07,071
I love rock too.

718
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:11,406
I heard you showed off
your drumming skills recently.

719
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:12,861
Really?

720
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,694
I had a solo performance for our concert.

721
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:19,374
I decided to show people my drumming.

722
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,525
You learned how to play the drums?

723
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:23,717
I did but less than 10 lessons.

724
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:24,695
It was less than 10 lessons...

725
00:35:24,695 --> 00:35:26,693
I bet you practiced hard since
it was for your concert.

726
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:28,429
I just learned the basics.

727
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,190
(Modest and embarrassed)

728
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,886
Still not easy to learn
in less than 10 lessons.

729
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:34,877
That's why... We prepared this.

730
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:36,003
Show them.

731
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,115
What's that?

732
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:40,922
(We prepared this just for Ji Soo)

733
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,487
A full drum kit.

734
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:44,862
For real.

735
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:47,686
- Actual drums.
- We prepared a lot.

736
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:51,727
I love rock music too,
so I really want to see this.

737
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,278
The bass.

738
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,662
How do I do this?

739
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,911
- Just play however you like.
- Do whatever you want.

740
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:01,609
Just do what you want.
Freestyle.

741
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:04,059
- Go?
- She looks so cool.

742
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,075
So cool.

743
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,559
I'm so nervous.

744
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,672
(Serious)

745
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:15,503
(Let's watch Ji Soo play the drums)

746
00:36:26,826 --> 00:36:28,503
(Drumming)

747
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,056
(This girl is so cool!)

748
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:35,500
(Bravo, Ji Soo)

749
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,477
She's good.

750
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:39,049
- Can you play what you just played.
- So cool.

751
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:40,482
Are you going to rap?

752
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:42,185
(Ji Soo's drumming with
Sang Min's crying rap)

753
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,188
(So cute)

754
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:46,987
Ji Soo's drum and my rapping!

755
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,243
Okay, okay.

756
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:50,496
Let's get it!

757
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,773
Lovelyz is on Weekly Idol!

758
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,116
(Oh! Oh!)

759
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:58,869
Come on!

760
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,859
(The other hosts are embarrassed)

761
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,243
(Shin Young is dying)

762
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,301
(Please stop...)

763
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:16,512
You're not supposed to laugh at me!

764
00:37:16,512 --> 00:37:17,880
(But you were so funny!)

765
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,291
I'm not joking here...

766
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,442
(Ow, my stomach)

767
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:22,539
Oh, my stomach...

768
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,729
(The embarrassment won't go away...)

769
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,951
There are old guys like that
on "Korea Sings."

770
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:31,573
There are guys like him.

771
00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:32,358
(Cracking up)

772
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:36,233
Guys just come on and start singing...

773
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,664
Ji Soo, that was great.

774
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,747
(Ji Soo's good at the drums)

775
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:46,896
10 lessons of drumming.

776
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:48,799
- Amazing.
- I'm embarrassed.

777
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,126
Next.

778
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:51,191
Jin!

779
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:53,743
She can sing any song like a ballad.

780
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,272
- Nice.
- That's hard.

781
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,101
I don't do this because I want to.

782
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:00,277
But no matter what song I sing,

783
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,526
the composers say it sounds like a ballad.

784
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:03,382
Really?

785
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:07,774
That's when I realized I could sing
any song like a ballad.

786
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,351
Shall we hear her then?

787
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:11,085
Let's start with a dance song.

788
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:13,462
- "Ah-Choo."
- "Ah-Choo."

789
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:18,574
(How will she sing this bubbly song?)

790
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:21,093
♪ Ah-choo ♪

791
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:25,494
♪ Seeing you makes me want to sneeze ♪

792
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:30,765
♪ I have many things I want to tell you ♪

793
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:33,512
That last part.

794
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,935
A lot of grooving and breathing.

795
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:37,993
Right, the way you breathe...

796
00:38:37,993 --> 00:38:39,535
Such a different groove.

797
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,735
Can you sing a trot song
like a ballad?

798
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:43,081
A trot song?

799
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:45,927
- "Oh My."
- That sounds good.

800
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,768
5, 6, 7, 8.

801
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:51,200
♪ Oh my, oh my ♪

802
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,696
♪ Please don't do this ♪

803
00:38:53,696 --> 00:39:00,139
♪ A woman's heart changes frequently ♪

804
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:04,240
(She can really sing any song like a ballad)

805
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,652
She's good at singing.

806
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:08,012
She's good at singing.

807
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,132
Next, let's look at Ye In!

808
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:13,126
The youngest. Ye In.

809
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:17,245
If you look at Ji Soo's chemistry
with the members...

810
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:22,013
"Ye In has the sexy body that I want."

811
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:23,885
That's what she wrote.

812
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,701
What part of her body do you want?

813
00:39:25,701 --> 00:39:26,884
All of it.

814
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:28,005
All of it?

815
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:30,980
She's slim yet firm.

816
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,156
She's been dancing since she was a kid.

817
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:35,461
All I did was play computer games as a kid.

818
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:37,728
(A sudden confession)

819
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,953
I just played computer games.

820
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:43,328
So I'm really envious of how firm she is.
I want her body.

821
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:45,168
Do you agree?

822
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:48,825
She's always telling me how
jealous she is of my body.

823
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:51,177
It's not that nice but
she keeps saying that.

824
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,320
You seem happy about this.

825
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Well, it is nice.

826
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,601
All girls like hearing that.

827
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:59,067
Do you think about it when you're
walking in front of Ji Soo?

828
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,639
A bit.

829
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:06,596
Ye In also put on a special performance
during their concert.

830
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:08,130
- Yes...
- What did you do?

831
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,890
I danced to Park Ji Yoon's "Coming of Age."

832
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,610
Now that I'm 21...

833
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,946
Unless you have a nice figure,
that dance looks weird.

834
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:19,219
- You'll seem like Psy.
- For real.

835
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:22,005
Can you dance here?

836
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,229
Can we see it?

837
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,927
This is...

838
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,495
Do you have the song?

839
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:28,767
- We have all the songs.
- We have Park Ji Yoon backstage.

840
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,378
Ji Yoon!

841
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:31,465
(She's laughing a lot today!)

842
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,025
I don't remember. Oh, no.

843
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:34,058
Just relax.

844
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,663
I don't remember the dance.

845
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,469
(Transforms)

846
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,678
(She doesn't remember but her body does...)

847
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:49,126
(Kei is embarrassed)

848
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,670
(I am no longer a little girl)

849
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,636
The highlight.

850
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,605
(Shaking)

851
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,981
(Ye In just made history with that dance)

852
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,401
That was funny.

853
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:17,113
The pride of Okcheon. Mi Joo.

854
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:20,289
She wrote this as her skill. Silly dancing.

855
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,525
Let's see her silly dancing.

856
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:23,445
Can you show us?

857
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:26,573
There's a silly dancer amongst us too.

858
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:28,377
Se Yoon!

859
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,317
I've never done a silly dance here.

860
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:33,077
I feel like I'll lose because...

861
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:35,045
I've never been funny by dancing.

862
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:36,230
Cue the music.

863
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,409
Who dances first?

864
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:42,857
(Looks so relaxed)

865
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,231
- She's good.
- She's too good!

866
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:54,832
- Go, Se Yoon!
- Go! Go!

867
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:58,592
(Flapping)

868
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:13,351
What was that?

869
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,492
(She can make dance moves to any song)

870
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:20,390
What is this?

871
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,251
How can I beat that?

872
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,509
(Chaotic)

873
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:27,642
Protect Mi Joo.

874
00:42:27,642 --> 00:42:28,875
How can I beat that?

875
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,793
Mi Joo needs to be protected.

876
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:33,545
How can I beat that?

877
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:36,409
She had her feet like this!

878
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:38,652
How did you walk like this?
Did you learn ballet?

879
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:41,388
(I'll show you)

880
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:42,692
How can I beat that?

881
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:44,204
Goodness...

882
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:45,980
Keep going since it's a battle.

883
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,936
- Can't I just watch?
- No, no.

884
00:42:47,936 --> 00:42:50,683
- How do I beat that?
- Cue the music.

885
00:42:50,683 --> 00:42:52,752
How do I beat that?

886
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,366
(She changes whenever she hears music)

887
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,563
How are you doing that with your feet?

888
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:04,663
Mi Joo.

889
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:07,032
Your turn, Se Yoon.

890
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:09,340
(An homage of Mi Joo)

891
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,419
(Trying his best)

892
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:14,807
(Leg lift!)

893
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,279
Don't, Mi Joo!

894
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:19,071
(How about this?)

895
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,200
(Sheesh, Mi Joo)

896
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,232
Cue the music.

897
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,860
("Monkey Magic" by Lee Park Sa)

898
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,752
(She can dance to any genre)

899
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:28,624
You can't beat her.
How is she doing this?

900
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:30,143
(Mi Joo...)

901
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:31,547
Cue the music.

902
00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:32,799
What's this?

903
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:34,997
("Ring Ring" by Kim Young Chul)

904
00:43:35,288 --> 00:43:37,265
(A dancing master doesn't blame the music)

905
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:39,066
Hold on. Time out.

906
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,547
(This dancing machine can't be stopped)

907
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:42,611
Mi Joo, time out.

908
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:45,787
Hold on, hold on.

909
00:43:45,787 --> 00:43:49,118
Sorry, but she needs protection.

910
00:43:50,414 --> 00:43:53,045
Mi Joo is the top dancer here.

911
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:56,267
She's the best.

912
00:43:56,267 --> 00:44:00,653
The one who made the legendary clip here.

913
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:03,517
It's Kei.

914
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:04,644
She wrote flower for all of them.

915
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,259
This is her opinion.

916
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:09,532
All the members see you as a flower.

917
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:12,277
Only Mi Joo is the fan.

918
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,228
A fan of what?

919
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:16,430
I'm a fan of "Rilakkuma."

920
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,886
I'm a fan of the cartoon.

921
00:44:17,886 --> 00:44:19,142
You have a bunch of dolls?

922
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:20,720
I have a bunch in my room.

923
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,791
Which Mi Joo doesn't really like.

924
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:26,864
She said she doesn't annoy people.

925
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,917
Unbelievable...

926
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:32,809
- I have something to say.
- What is it?

927
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:34,056
Hold on.

928
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,199
Okay, okay.

929
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:38,533
Cue the music!

930
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:40,400
Talk as you dance.

931
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,031
I have something to say.

932
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:45,436
I don't like dolls.

00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,926
I couldn't believe my ears.
I don't like dolls.

935
00:44:50,926 --> 00:44:53,582
Half the space in our room...

936
00:44:53,582 --> 00:44:55,646
Is taken up by dolls.

937
00:44:55,646 --> 00:44:58,179
Our room is split in half.

938
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:02,236
Our furniture is different too.
Our styles are totally different.

Yes.

942
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,742
Really? Thank you.

943
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:16,182

Does she really have a flower face?

945
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,933
We should see if she has a flower face.

946
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:23,717

(Is this the tonguequalizer?)

1034
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,271
She kept using her tongue
because of Se Yoon.

1035
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:23,434
She shouldn't have watched his.

1036

Su Jeong needs protection.

1037
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:28,605

- Yeah.

No, no. You didn't have to.

1042
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:41,049

You have 10 questions and 3 minutes.

1056
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:21,157

If you guess wrong, we'll be eating
the remaining food.

1061
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,589
We really don't want to eat.

1062

You tell me.

1068
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:51,822
The music should be loud.

1069

00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,610
Ganggang sullae!

1099
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,053
(Ding dong, Kei)

1100
00:51:53,053 --> 00:51:55,221
Just mouth it out.

1101
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:56,829
Gang.

1102
00:51:56,829 --> 00:51:57,700
Gang.

1103
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,996
Ganggang sullae!

1104
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,891
Ganggang sullae!

1105
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:03,160
- Moon.
- Full moon.

1106
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,708
Ganggang sullae! Ganggang sullae!

1107
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:11,177
(Ganggang sullae)

1108
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,454
(Can't get through to her)

1109
00:52:13,454 --> 00:52:15,750
On a full moon do the ganggang sullae!

1110
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,825
(Let's just dance!)

1111
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,745
(Now it's become charades)

1112
00:52:22,246 --> 00:52:23,919
Ganggang sullae!

1113
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:25,979
(Kei is pleased)

1114
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,827
(They're having fun with this)

1115
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,271
Ganggang sullae!

1116
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:35,467
(Baby Soul watches Mi Joo hop around)

1117
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,551
(One more time)

1118
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,001
The full moon! Peek-a-boo!

1119
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:45,263
(They all watch Mi Joo)

1120
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,288
She's doing it all.

1121
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,484
(Staring)

1122
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,163
(She doesn't care as long as she's excited)

1123
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:53,779
(Pressured...)

1124
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,756
Ganggang sullae!

1125
00:52:58,048 --> 00:53:00,603
(We thought Mi Joo would do well...)

1126
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:02,723
(She's a true variety show gem)

1127
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:05,342
No! No!

1128
00:53:05,342 --> 00:53:06,983
(No!)

1129
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:09,805
(5 characters?)

1130
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,367
No! Hold on.

1131
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,687
Tell us. Tell me what it is.

1132
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:15,954
Ganggang suwollae!

1133
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:17,639
Yeah, I think you got it.

1134
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,228
That's not how you say it.

1135
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:22,088
(Loudly)

1136
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:26,152
Ganggang suwollae!

1137
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:30,307
Ganggang suwollae!

1138
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,676
- Ganggang suwollae?
- Ganggang suwollae.

1139
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,678
Ganggang suwollae? Ganggang sullae.

1140
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:36,478
(Huh?)

1141
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:37,487
Wasn't that right?

1142
00:53:37,487 --> 00:53:39,189
(Trying to figure things out)

1143
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:40,446
You said suwollae.

1144
00:53:40,446 --> 00:53:43,301
Hurry and do the next one!
You don't have time!

1145
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:45,225
- Hold on.
- Let's do this.

1146
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,825
- Turn around.
- Let's do a hard one.

1147
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:51,897
(Iodine solution)

1148
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:53,690
(What is that?)

1149
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,921
This is a good one.

1150
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:57,545
Iodine solution.

1151
00:53:57,545 --> 00:53:58,113
What?

1152
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,292
- I...
- Do...

1153
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:02,614
- O...
- Yo...

1154
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,103
Yo!

1155
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,304
- Dine...
- Ji...

1156
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:07,152
So...

1157
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:07,801
Lu...

1158
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:09,795
- So, so...
- Ji...

1159
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:10,980
So...

1160
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,568
She's stubborn.

1161
00:54:13,085 --> 00:54:15,276
(They're just dancing)

1162
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:17,503
(Ye In dances to the rhythm)

1163
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:18,434
(Still stuck!)

1164
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,491
Iodine.

1165
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,723
(Still stuck on one syllable)

1166
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:22,978
Iodine.

1167
00:54:22,978 --> 00:54:23,737
Dine.

1168
00:54:23,737 --> 00:54:26,363
- Iodine.
- Solution.

1169
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,079
- Yeah.
- Iodine. Yeah.

1170
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:31,079
- Solu...
- Iodine what?

1171
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,561
(3 minutes ended a long time ago...)

1172
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,288
- Iodine smell.
- Keep going.

1173
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:36,400
- Keep going.
- You're short on time.

1174
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,742
I...

1175
00:54:38,315 --> 00:54:41,108
Iodine smell.

1176
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:42,692
(Jin is the black hole)

1177
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:44,252
Iodine smell.

1178
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:45,925
Huh?

1179
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:47,485
Iodine smell.

1180
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:48,101
Huh?

1181
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:49,396
(It sounds so weird)

1182
00:54:49,396 --> 00:54:52,789
Iodine smell.

1183
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,572
(No idea)

1184
00:54:55,572 --> 00:54:57,508
- What are you saying?
- Keep going.

1185
00:54:57,508 --> 00:55:00,226
Keep going.

1186
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:02,444
(One more time)

1187
00:55:02,444 --> 00:55:04,874
(Keeps saying the wrong answer)

1188
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:09,161
(Back)

1189
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:11,658
(Jin's wrong answer)

1190
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:14,550
(Acting silly)

1191
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,319
Keep going.

1192
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:17,198
Ji Ae, keep going.

1193
00:55:17,198 --> 00:55:18,683
(Just go!)

1194
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:21,317
(Gives up)

1195
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,485
Ro?

1196
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,396
Dol?

1197
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:25,221
Loco?

1198
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,539
Iodine smell!

1199
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,059
(Watching)

1200
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,596
(Iodine solution, iodine smell, dolphin cry)

1201
00:55:30,596 --> 00:55:31,743
Dolphin cry.

1202
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:33,135
Iodine smell.

1203
00:55:33,135 --> 00:55:34,254
Dolphin?

1204
00:55:34,254 --> 00:55:35,518
Iodine smell.

1205
00:55:35,518 --> 00:55:36,926
(I should watch from up close)

1206
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:38,459
(Jin changes the wrong answer)

1207
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,368
Iodine scent.

1208
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:43,884
Iodine.

1209
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:46,162
Iodine scent. What is that?

1210
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:49,770
(Tries not to laugh!)

1211
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:53,821
The clock is ticking.

1212
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:55,761
(You guys ran out of time long ago)

1213
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:57,817
Keep going.

1214
00:55:57,817 --> 00:55:59,816
Lumbar...

1215
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,105
Iodine smell.

1216
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:03,595
(Serious)

1217
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:07,774
Keep going.

1218
00:56:07,774 --> 00:56:09,737
- One more time.
- Hurry up and just go.

1219
00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:12,514
Hurry up and just go.

1220
00:56:12,514 --> 00:56:14,364
(Tell me)

1221
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:17,424
Lum...

1222
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:20,712
Lumbar...

1223
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:23,583
Lumbar...

1224
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:25,935
(The first one in line can only laugh...)

1225
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:27,529
- Lumbar.
- Lumbar?

1226
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:28,936
Lumbar?

1227
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:30,068
System?

1228
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:33,023
(Now it's lumbar system?)

1229
00:56:33,362 --> 00:56:37,667
Lumbar system.

1230
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,476
- That's what they're saying?
- System.

1231
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:40,388
System.

1232
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:43,766
- Lumbar system.
- Keep going!

1233
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:46,916
I have no idea.

1234
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:51,100
(So excited)

1235
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:54,338
Ah-choo.

1236
00:56:54,338 --> 00:56:55,292
♪ Ah-choo ♪

1237
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:57,395
Lumbar.

1238
00:56:57,395 --> 00:56:59,106
System.

1239
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:00,787
(They're stuck on system...)

1240
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:02,084
- Huh?
- I'm not sure.

1241
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:04,219
She did this...

1242
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:05,988
Yo, ah-choo. What's this?

1243
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,629
I don't know either.

1244
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:09,782
What's the word?

1245
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:11,759
Lumbar.

1246
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,604
(Is there even such a word?)

1247
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:24,991
Yo, ah-choo, bang!

1248
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:26,679
Bang!

1249
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:31,558
(That's what she did)

1250
00:57:32,474 --> 00:57:35,200
(An explanation with hip hop and K-Pop)

1251
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,589
Bang.

1252
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:38,663
I don't know.

1253
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,356
(This is nuts)

1254
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,189
I don't know.

1255
00:57:43,189 --> 00:57:44,437
What's this?

1256
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:46,782
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

1257
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:48,701
Just keep going.

1258
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,282
Keep going.

Yo...

1260
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,925
(They're like rappers now)

1261
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:56,132
Ah-choo.

1262
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:58,004
(Promoting their song)

1263
00:57:58,004 --> 00:57:58,916
Choo?

1264
00:57:58,916 --> 00:57:59,908
Ah-choo.

1265
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,353
Ah-choo.

1266
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,962
Bang!

1267
00:58:03,902 --> 00:58:05,419
That's...

1268
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:08,612
Yo, ah-choo...

1269
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:10,275
- Bang.
- Bang?

1270
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:13,448
(Now it's yo ah-choo bang)

1271
00:58:14,014 --> 00:58:15,156
What's the answer?

1272
00:58:15,156 --> 00:58:16,772
What's the answer?

1273
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:18,220
What's the answer?

1274
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,351
This time next year?

1275
00:58:19,351 --> 00:58:20,451
Yo ah-choo bang?

1276
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:23,547
(Nope)

1277
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:25,815
The answer is iodine solution.

1278
00:58:25,815 --> 00:58:27,071
Iodine solution.

1279
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:29,121
(My snacks)

1280
00:58:29,121 --> 00:58:31,128
I said iodine smell.

1281
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:32,808
Iodine smell.

1282
00:58:32,808 --> 00:58:36,734
We gave you 10 minutes.

1283
00:58:36,734 --> 00:58:37,550
We didn't get a single one.

1284
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,518
Let's just do this.

1285
00:58:39,518 --> 00:58:41,944
They really want to eat but
the questions were too hard.

1286
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:43,848
We'll change the order and give
you another chance.

1287
00:58:43,848 --> 00:58:45,098
How should we change it up?

1288
00:58:45,098 --> 00:58:47,131
I'll stay in the center.

1289
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:50,228
But you can suddenly change the answer.

1290
00:58:50,228 --> 00:58:51,205
(Wrongly accused)

1291
00:58:51,205 --> 00:58:54,709
At least I got iodine right.

1292
00:58:55,353 --> 00:58:57,978
If you get this one right,
you get 3 snacks.

1293
00:58:57,978 --> 00:59:00,389
Get ready. Start.

1294
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,345
(Mind goes blank)

1295
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,715
Mind goes blank.

1296
00:59:05,715 --> 00:59:06,980
(Rushing)

1297
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,849
- Mind blank.
- Mind blank.

1298
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:09,852
Mind goes blank.

1299
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:11,619
(They get it right)

1300
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:12,867
Turn around.

1301
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,292
Mind goes blank.

1302
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:17,231
(I got it!)

1303
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:18,879
(They're on the right track so far)

1304
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:20,013
Okay, they're fast.

1305
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,563
(Jin is next)

1306
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:27,038
Mind...

1307
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:30,729
I'll stay in the center.

1308
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:34,403
(Jin acted like she was the best one)

1309
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:36,854
(How will she do?)

1310
00:59:36,854 --> 00:59:39,324
Mind goes blank.

1311
00:59:39,324 --> 00:59:42,313
(Super focused)

1312
00:59:42,702 --> 00:59:44,838
Metal?

1313
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:46,525
Mind, mind.

1314
00:59:46,525 --> 00:59:48,245
Goes blank.

1315
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:50,016
- Goes blank.
- Goes black.

1316
00:59:50,016 --> 00:59:51,592
(Can't get through to her)

1317
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,523
Mind goes blank.

1318
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,415
(You're not the best at this Jin...)

1319
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:59,133
(Can't communicate)

1320
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:00,975
Turn around.

1321
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,478
- Mind goes blank.
- Mind goes blank.

1322
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:05,813
(Jin is no longer the black hole!)

1323
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:06,918
Mind...

1324
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:08,011
Mind...

1325
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:09,458
Goes blank.

1326
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:12,158
(So tactful)

1327
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:14,183
She knows.

1328
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:18,100
(Looks like we'll get this
and get a snack)

1329
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:21,369
(How will dancing Mi Joo do?)

1330
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:24,267
Mind...

1331
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:26,777
Mi Joo knows?

1332
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:30,031
Mind...

1333
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:31,281
Half moon.

1334
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:33,152
- Brain. Mind.
- Half moon.

1335
01:00:33,152 --> 01:00:34,487
Mind. Mind.

1336
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:35,232
Half moon.

1337
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,040
(Her mind is going blank for real)

1338
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,174
Mind goes blank!

1339
01:00:39,174 --> 01:00:41,551
We need someone like this.

1340
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:44,038
Half moon goes blank.

1341
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:46,210
Turn around.

1342
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,090
Mind, mind.

1343
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,995
(Please!)

1344
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:50,188
Turn around.

1345
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,301
Goes blank.

1346
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,851
Half moon split?

1347
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:54,934
Turn around.

1348
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:56,733
Half moon split?

1349
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:57,661
Turn around.

1350
01:00:57,661 --> 01:00:58,775
(Oh, no)

1351
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,279
Heo Cham would love her.

1352
01:01:01,279 --> 01:01:04,774
Half moon goes blank.

1353
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,735
(Clapping)

1354
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:10,372
Mind goes blank.

1355
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:13,598
Mind goes blank.

1356
01:01:13,874 --> 01:01:15,386
(Su Jeong seems so cool right now)

1357
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:18,275
That was unexpected.

1358
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,287
(What's the answer?)

1359
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:23,330
(Nervous)

1360
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:27,397
Mind goes blank.

1361
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:29,752
Mind goes blank.

1362
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:30,836
Correct!

1363
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:34,762
(So excited)

1364
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:38,184
You got one right so you
get 3 snacks.

1365
01:01:38,184 --> 01:01:39,273
3.

1366
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:40,998
(They forget about their victory!)

1367
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:43,603
It's wasteful to just eat this.

1368
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:45,123
Let's eat the pizza.

1369
01:01:45,123 --> 01:01:47,011
Let's eat the total opposite.
Spicy rice cakes.

1370
01:01:47,011 --> 01:01:49,203
No, they got cold.

1371
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:50,627
We need meat.

1372
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,485
The pork hocks.

1373
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:55,681
They're so serious.

1374
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:57,097
- Should we eat squid?
- We've decided.

1375
01:01:57,097 --> 01:01:59,044
You did? What? Pizza, pork hocks...

1376
01:01:59,044 --> 01:02:01,660
And squid stir-fry.

1377
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,876
You can eat those 3 snacks.

1378
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:07,556
Congratulations!

1379
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:08,995
Thank you for the food.

1380
01:02:08,995 --> 01:02:10,898
Eat up.

1381
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,241
It's so good.

1382
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,637
It's so good.

1383
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,861
(Just watching them eat makes us full...)

1384
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,293
(Nom)

1385
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:22,525
This is good.

1386
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:24,726
Thank you.

1387
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:27,285
Lovelyz are lovely no matter what.

1388
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,833
This is the Network Quiz!

1389
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:34,933
We changed things up a bit.

1390
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:39,073
The winner will get to give these
dolls to your fans.

1391
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:43,642
(Lovelyz will try for their fans!)

1392
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:47,863
(I'll win 1st!)

1393
01:02:48,355 --> 01:02:50,629
(So determined)

1394
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:53,502
No.

1395
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:57,150
A goddess like Mi Joo...

1396
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,410
No.

1397
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,608
Wrong!

1398
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:02,500
(Thinking of their fans!)

1399
01:03:03,032 --> 01:03:04,376
(I'll get this right!)

1400
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:05,841
I know what this is!

1401
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:07,977
You're almost there!

1402
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,747
It's multiple choice.

1403
01:03:09,747 --> 01:03:11,873
- We have up to 74 choices.
- Su Jeong!

1404
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:12,649
Su Jeong.

1405
01:03:12,649 --> 01:03:15,033
- 12. Yellow dust.
- 12. Yellow dust?

1406
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:16,825
14. Yellow dust.

1407
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:18,520
14. Yellow dust.

1408
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,240
Ye In!

1409
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,328
Ye In.

1410
01:03:21,328 --> 01:03:22,744
Hunseok.

1411
01:03:22,744 --> 01:03:23,964
Correct!

1412
01:03:24,312 --> 01:03:25,760
(Ye In is really killing it)

1413
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,752
Ye In.

1414
01:03:26,752 --> 01:03:27,712
I want to eat raw fish.

1415
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:29,428
Correct!

1416
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:33,123
(I just do what I do!)

1417
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:35,218
This means Ye In wins

1418
01:03:35,218 --> 01:03:39,890
and she gets 100 dolls for her fans!

1419
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,730
(The winner of the Network Quiz is Ye In)

1420
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:45,098
Since Ye In won...

1421
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:49,138
How about a message to your fans?

1422
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:54,750
Fans, I hope you cherish these dolls

1423
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,375
and take them to bed as you think of me!

1424
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,771
Okay!

1425
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:02,967
It's time to end our show for today.

1426
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,446
We had so much fun.

1427
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:07,248
- Did you have fun?
- So much fun!

1428
01:04:07,248 --> 01:04:08,344
What a relief.

1429
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:12,296
I feel like we got closer over
that brief period.

1430
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:14,471
People say how lovely you girls are.

1431
01:04:14,471 --> 01:04:16,351
Now I can see it too.

1432
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:18,033
(Thank you)

1433
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:21,837
So awkward...

1434
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,620
I'll scratch my head.

1435
01:04:25,759 --> 01:04:27,144
Let's wrap things up.

1436
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:28,767
- Whether it's here...
- Or there...

1437
01:04:28,767 --> 01:04:31,727
In the end... Weekly Idol!

1438
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:33,471
Please give "That Day" lots of love.

1439
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:35,075
Lovelyz.

1440
01:04:44,935 --> 01:04:47,867
(They're so lovely powerful)

1441
01:04:48,447 --> 01:04:51,293
(Thank you for your positive energy, Lovelyz!)

1442
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:54,605
(We'll see you again next episode)

1443
01:04:54,605 --> 01:04:56,289
Good work, girls.

1444
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,993
