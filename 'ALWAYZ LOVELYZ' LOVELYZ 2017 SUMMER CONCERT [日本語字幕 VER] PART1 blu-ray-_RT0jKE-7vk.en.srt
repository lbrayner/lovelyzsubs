A lot of you are here at our second concert [ALWAYZ]

62
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,130
Let us first say hello, two, three...

63
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,100
Hello, we are LOVELYZ.

64
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,560
Hello!

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,300
Hello, I'm JiAe of LOVELYZ.

66
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,140
Hello, I'm JIN of LOVELYZ.

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,010
Everyone, I've missed you.
I'm YeIn.

68
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Everyone, I really really missed you. I'm JiSoo.

69
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,920
Everyone, I really really really missed you. I'm MiJoo.

70
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,460
Everyone, it's good to see you. I'm SuJeong.

71
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,700
Hello, I'm Leader Baby Soul.

72
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Hello, I'm Flower Kei.

73
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,770
What's different from yesterday is that we're filming a DVD today.

74
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,610
Oh, oh, scream!!

75
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,820
So we will appreciate it if you enjoy yourselves
and help us to make a good film.

76
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,680
Fighting!

77
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,460
The heat is high since more of you are here today than yesterday.

78
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,060
Thank you.

79
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
You're the best!

80
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,670
Just like yesterday, the first appearance
is the most nervous part

81
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,770
Right, unnies?

82
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,600
I was really nervous.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,070
Did you sleep well? YES!!!

84
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,410
Because I had a very exciting concert
with LOVELINUS yesterday,

85
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,010
I had a good dream.

86
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,220
- What was it?
- What was it about?

87
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,880
- Did you really dream?
- What was the dream about?

88
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,290
I had a dream that made me feel so good.

89
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,250
Oh, really?

90
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,490
Of course.

91
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,220
Tell us, tell us, tell us.

92
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,290
- I think we'll hit the jackpot.
- You want me to tell?

93
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,230
You shouldn't talk about your dreams!

94
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,700
You can say it a day after.

95
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,730
Then, I'll tell you tomorrow.

96
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,800
I couldn't sleep yesterday.

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,300
But I came here today and
energized myself with food.

98
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,370
And I'm here to enjoy despite the hotness.

99
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,600
Then shall we make a powerful stage
with LOVELINUS today?

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,310
YES!

101
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,050
There are so many of you here.

102
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,800
When the courtains fell down,
I couldn't hide my happiness.

103
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,390
- It's so nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you!

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,930
Is there anyone who came yesterday?

105
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,430
<i>YES!!</i>

106
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,030
Then, who came for the first time today?

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,940
Hello~~

108
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,610
For the first comers here,
do you know the title of our concert?

109
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
<i>ALWAYZ!!</i>

110
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,110
Please, explain the meaning of the concert title, Baby Soul.

111
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,850
Our concert...

112
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,300
She's putting it up on me.

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,150
Our concert title is 'ALWAYZ',

114
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,590
was made up from ALWAYS and LOVELYZ.
That's why it's 'ALWAYZ'.

115
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,990
It means that we will be always with you.

116
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,400
I like it so much.

117
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm fluttered.

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,170
Did you like the opening clip?

119
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,730
<i>YES!!</i>

120
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,800
Did you like it?

121
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,940
<i>YES!!!</i>

122
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,240
We had a promise ceremony at the opening clip.

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,710
- That's right.
- That's right.

124
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,650
You promise that you'll join our clip next time, right?

125
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,350
All of you should come together next time.

126
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,750
The atmosphere is really hot from the beginning.

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,090
- It's hot, hot!
- I really like it.

128
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,690
So let's make an historical concert today.

129
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,970
We, LOVELYZ, have prepared lots of things
for LOVELINUS today, right?

130
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,900
Right, right.

131
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,940
You can expect a better stage following
'Lovelyz in Winterland'.

132
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,810
The LOVELINUS that are here today,

133
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,180
and the LOVELINUS who were here yesterday.

134
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,090
We will greatly appreciate it if you cheer for LOVELYZ
so loud that the Olympic Hall would break down.

135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,130
But before we continue, there's something you have to promise me.

136
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,600
The people at the standing area, please promise me
that you'll watch the concert safely.

137
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Promise! Wah, thank you so much.

138
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,970
Then...

139
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,540
- Then?
- Shall we go to the next stage?

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,370
- YES!!
- Let's go?

141
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,740
Okey, let's go to the next stage. Let's go!!

Everyone, this place is really...

246
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
The ferris wheel turned all night

247
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,760
This part was much louder than yesterday.

248
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,700
Since this is our JiAe's part...

249
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,870
shall we do it once more with JiAe's dance moves?

250
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,940
It's ok?

251
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,440
You should do it together with us.

252
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,670
Do it with us.

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,610

257
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,150
The voice of our LOVELINUS is louder than the drums.

258
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,520
You are the best!

259
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,030
Joyland stage can only be seen during our concerts,

260
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,400
So it feels new to me.

261
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,770
You come to our concerts to do this, don't you?

262
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,270
You come here to sing the ferris wheel!

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,110
The ones at the back shouted together, right?

264
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,910
Right?

265
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,440
- Your voice is small!!
- One more!!

266
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,180
- Wow, they are the best.
- Thank you so much.

267
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,520
When we see up from here,
we can see people who don't answer to us.

268
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,340
- Who?
- Who?

269
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,090
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

270
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,260
I'll find you and go next to you.

271
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,160
- Who is it?
- I'm going!

272
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,160
Who is it?

273
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,650
Push and pull!

274
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,000
JiSoo really wants to see you closer.

275
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,900
LOVELYZ wants to see you closer.

276
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,770
There's a stage we will go closer to you,

277
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,940
so see you closer later!

278
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,140
See you later~

279
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
For this concert being held in a long time,

280
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,500
we were at the training room just a week ago.

281
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,920
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

282
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,890
It was really fun but exhausting.

283
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,720
It was fun but tiring, yes.

284
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We missed you all so much
that we wished time would fly.

285
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,060
After 'Now, We',

286
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,800
we worked so hard for this concert
thinking about our LOVELINUS.

287
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,500
- Let's each say what we actually did!
- What we actually did...

288
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,280
We went to Canada.

289
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,880
- Yes, we went to Canada.
- It's true.

290
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,210
To film 'LOVELYZ loves Canada'.

291
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,580
So we went to Canada and prepared our re-package album.

292
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,990
Soul learned yoga.

293
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,160
Let's stop talking about yoga.

294
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,960
We've been to Japan too.

295
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,730
- So it is.
- Yes.

296
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,500
We needed to charge ourselves after 'Now, We',

297
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,370
So we did take some time but it wasn't long.

298
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,740
With 'ALWAYZ' as the starting point,
we'll do our best in the second half.

299
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,970
- If we run.
- You run too.

300
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,980
- We should run together.
- LOVELINUS should.

301
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,380
Run!

302
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,580
Yes, LOVELINUS should run with us.

303
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,780
There's no time to rest, everyone.
Will you raise up your energy in today's concert too?

304
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,320
<i>YES!!!</i>

305
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,820
We will show our LOVELINUS the next stage~

306
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,260
Let's go!

307
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,000

Your reactions are so hot.

1032
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,320
Everyone, we came up to the closer stage.

1033
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,000
Can people far away also see us?

1034
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,900
Can you?

1035
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,830
We will go closer~

1036
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,970
This is the 2nd floor, and this is the 3rd floor.

1037
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,070
- It's very vague.
- 1, 2...

1038
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,840
I don't know where is the 3rd floor.

1039
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,610
The 2nd and 3rd floor joins here.

1040
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,770
- 2.5
- I see.

1041
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:45,610
Ah, 1.5 floor.

1042
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:49,710
You join together because LOVELINUS is one, right?

1043
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,120
Please, everyone, give me some good reactions.

1044
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,450
Please, give me good reactions.

1045
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,400
- Did you watch LOVELYZ Diary 4.5?
- Yes!!

1046
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,430
How was it?

1047
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,030
Do you want season 5?

1048
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,170
- Do you want it?
- <i>Yes!!</i>

1049
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,870
Then we should film it, don't we?

1050
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,060
- We should film it.
- PD JinSoo, where are you?

1051
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:20,010
We showed a unit during 'LOVELYZ in Winterland', remember?

1052
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,420
And today it was a different unit.

1053
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,950
- Did you enjoy it?
- <i>YES!!!</i>

1054
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:29,640
- But I... what?
- Thank you so much.

1055
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,960
- He said 'Morning Star' is the best.
- Wow, thank you.

1056
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,180
'My little lover' is the best. 'The' is the best.

1057
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,850
They are saying we are all the best.

1058
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,390
All the stages were so good, but I personally think...

1059
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:46,670
JiAe and JiSoo's 'My litte lover' was very impressive.

1060
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,810
What was the intro?

1061
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:52,810
I purposely... who came to 'LOVELYZ in Winterland'?

1062
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,580
<i>Me!!!</i>

1063
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:56,580
Wow, a lot of you came!

1064
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,850
I wanted to remind you of the memories, and continue the feelings,

1065
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:04,160
So I used a music box for the intro, which was our song 'Doll'.

1066
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,220
What do you think?

1067
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,590
- It was so good. Unnie, I really liked it.
- Thank you so much.

1068
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,300
It's like a fantasy.

1069
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,200
And JiAe played the piano by herself.

1070
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,840
JiAe really practiced hard playing the piano.

1071
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,060
It turned all night.

1072
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,080
- It turned all night?
- The piano sound went on all night.

1073
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,100
She's the best.

1074
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,380
We were thinking about what to do.

1075
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,920
I learned the piano when I was young.

1076
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,090
I prepared it in such a long time just for you.

1077
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,810
How was it?

1078
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:39,200
- It was really good.
- Thank you so much.

1079
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,590
Yoozart, Yoozart!

1080
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,390
How was 'Morning Star' from our team?

1081
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,630
It was so good!

1082
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,890
Everyone, you're the best.

1083
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,500
We will try to come up with more ballad songs.

1084
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,780
I cried at the backstage room listening to 'Morning Star'.

1085
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1086
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,880
But your make-up looks neat.

1087
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,880
My make-up?

1088
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,250
I cried inside.

1089
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:09,150
When I was fixing my make-up at the waiting room,
I saw the 'Morning Star' on the sky.

1090
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,920
Yes, thank you.

1091
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,190
Even the LOVELYZ members had high expectations on the 'Morning Star' stage.

1092
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:17,960
Give them an applause.

1093
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,440
Then shout out as much as you liked the high school rock performance.

1094
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:29,840
That YeIn, MiJoo and me did together.

1095
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,010
The reactions are really hot today.

1096
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,280
Our...

1097
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,450
Wow, yes, thank you so much.

1098
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,650
What to do?

1099
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:44,020
Did you get wet from the water gun of our love?

1100
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,860
But my water gun didn't work again.

1101
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:50,860
Me too. I was trying to shot, but it didn't work.

1102
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,630
Ah, really? I shot a lot today.

1103
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,470
Like this. This is what I did.

1104
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,700
I'm upset, I wanted to shoot all of you.

1105
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,210
We did that because we were worried that LOVELINUS might feel hot today.

1106
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:07,050
Was it cool? Okay then, next time it'll be iced water.

1107
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,400
We'll shoot it for you.

1108
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,880
- Next time we should use large bowls.
- Large bowls?

1109
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,980
- Large bowls.
- Will it be okay?

1110
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,290
Ah, yes, well.

1111
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:20,030
We prepared three unit stages for 'ALWAYZ' this time.

1112
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:27,370
Are you curious about how our next concert will be?

1113
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:33,470
I'm also curious about how the combinations will be.

1114
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:35,340
I heard Incheon Fam, Incheon fam.

1115
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,610
- Incheon fam?
- Incheon fan!

1116
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,440
Incheon fam, yeah!

1117
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,980
- I'm two-SuJeong.
- Two-SuJeong! Two-SuJeong!

1118
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,850
We are JinJi, JinJi.

1119
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:45,950
Okcheon, Okcheon!

1120
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:46,620
Okcheon!

1121
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,890
JinJi, JinJi!

1122
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,420
Mi-JiAe, Mi-JiAe.

1123
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,400
You girls, are used to be roommates before.

1124
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,670
The manager thought we weren't close enough, so she set us up.

1125
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,010
- And even wore cuffs.
- Now we are very close.

1126
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:07,770
You are close now.

1127
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,670
Yes, we are closer than anyone.

1128
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:11,640
That's right.

1129
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:14,450
- Yes?
- They want to see.

1130
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,750
Kiss! Kiss!

1131
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,590
- It's embarrassing.
- You don't know wich units will perform in concerts ahead us.

1132
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,590
You have to come to our concerts.

1133
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,790
You should be!

1134
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,090
It's a promise.

1135
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:34,300
How was the 'Aya' stage that you've been waiting for
after the 'Knock Knock' stage?

1136
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,470
Was it good?

1137
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,570
Good, good.

1138
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,210
- We were cute.
- Were we cute?

1139
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:44,640
I think the stethoscope choreography was the point.

1140
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,280
Point.

1141
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,880
We also threw t-shirts.

1142
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,720
JiSoo and I threw them.
And we shoot with guns, right?

1143
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,820
Who got the T-shirts?

1144
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,150
Who got them? Put your hands up.

1145
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:59,060
-Lucky guy, it went far.
- It really did.

1146
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:00,160
It went really far.

1147
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:00,960
Where are you?

1148
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:02,830
- It went really, really far.
- Where is he?

1149
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:04,630
- It must be the only one who can't see.
- I can't see too.

1150
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:08,000
- To be honest...
- Congratulations!

1151
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,200
When I was shooting the gun, one bullet went out,

1152
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,940
so I threw the T-shirt to this side.

1153
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,640
So one from here got it, and another one from there.

1154
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,910
- Angel.
- So wistful.

1155
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,150
- It's nice that you got it in different areas.
- yes, good!

1156
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,590
YeInnie hurted her leg during Cameo.

1157
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,190
Perfect whole LOVELYZ.

1158
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:31,720
Finally you can see the version with the eight of us.

1159
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,580
YeIn, how do you feel?

1160
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:39,620
I feel so good now since it feels like I'm in album promotion activities with you. I'm happy.

1161
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,600
I was so happy that I could finally perform 'Cameo' in front of more LOVELINUS.

1162
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,640
I liked it too.

1163
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,640
If you like it, then

1164
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:49,710
What?

1165
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,740
If you liked it, then let's go to next stage.

1166
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,910
Alright, alright.

1167
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,080
- The next stage is...
- What are we going to sing next?

1168
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,750
What are we going to sing now?

1169
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:02,990
The two song we are going to sing now
are LOVELYZ's emotional ballad songs.

1170
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,180
- Let's go.
- Let's sing them now.

01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,660
Everyone! Are you tired?

1349
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,000
<i>No!!!</i>

1350
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,070
If you are tired, MiJoo will get to you. What did I say?

1351
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,340
Are you tired?

1352
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:34,710
<i>No!!!</i>

1353
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:38,310
- Shall we test it by screaming?
- How can we check that?

1354
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:40,010
- How are you going to check them?
- Then first of all...

1355
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:42,650
Let's divide you by sections and do the shouting test.

1356
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,450
Good, good.

1357
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:46,750
Let's divide into standing area, and seats.
Four of us for each section.

1358
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,420
- Four on this side. And others on that side.
- Four, four!

1359
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:51,220
- Then, we take the standing area?
- We'll take the seats then.

1360
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,820
Kei's side will take the seats.

1361
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,790
Are you confident? We will show aegyo
to those who shout out softer.

1362
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,600
Shouldn't we show aegyo to those who shout louder?

1363
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,170
You are right. Are you ready for the aegyo? Soul unnie?

1364
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,040
Yes, we are going to show our aegyo

1365
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,740
to the area with louder voices.

1366
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:13,110
The aegyo set... If our team wins,

1367
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,810
What about Baby Soul's one-shot aegyo time?

1368
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,020
If your team wins?

1369
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,520
- If your team wins.
- If we win.

1370
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,150
Isn't it if we lose?

1371
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,260
Yes, if we lose.
And automatically that team will win.

1372
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,260
- Yes, if we win.
- We are being so stupid now.

1373
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,660
We keep changing words.

1374
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,130
- If our team wins.
- Our team.

1375
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:32,360
Who is in your team?

1376
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,860
We are the seat section.

1377
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,300
They take the seat section,
and we take the standing section.

1378
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,270
And if the voices of the seat section are louder,
our team has to do aegyo.

1379
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:41,440
That's right, that's right.

1380
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:46,410
We will show aegyo to the area with louder voices.

1381
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:47,040
Yes, right.

1382
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,110
Are you ready? Clear your throats.

1383
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,020
Wow, so good.

1384
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,390
They practiced, they did.

1385
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:01,530

1386
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,330
They are good.

1387
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:04,060
They are good. They are better than me.

1388
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,260
Shall we practice ourselves?

1389
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,300
- Yes.
- Shall we?

1390
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,530
- We are...
- Shall we step forward?

1391
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:13,140
Let's go closer to the seat section.

1392
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,340
I'll tell you how to do it this time.

1393
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,950
If we shout 'LOVELYZ' you guys can shout back 'I love you'.

1394
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,220
- I love you!
- Okay?

1395
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,990
Seat section, fighting!

1396
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,090
- Let's go, seats.
- Pull out your energy, everyone.

1397
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,060
Practice, practice.

1398
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,030
Shall we practice warming up?

1399
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,760
Shall we?

1400
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,830
Since the members are already out there,
let's warm up the seats first.

1401
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:44,000
One... go!

1402
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,870
One, two.

1403
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,910
- If we say 'seats' then they say 'I love you LOVELYZ'.
- We... no, no, no.

1404
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:50,770
If we shout 'LOVELYZ'.

1405
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:53,580
LOVELINUS should shout out 'I love you'.

1406
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,080
LOVELYZ.

1407
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,050
<i>I LOVE YOU!!</i>

1408
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:04,420
Will the standing section practice too?

1409
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,720
- We can't lose.
- Do we start too?

1410
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,860
Stop, until here when they practice.

1411
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:11,700
Until here when they practice.

1412
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,800
Now, one, two, three.

1413
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,100
LOVELYZ.

1414
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,030
<i>I LOVE YOU!!!</i>

1415
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,610
- Is it just how I feel? I think we are more...
- We can't lose, the seating area can't lose.

1416
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:22,540
We can't lose.

1417
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:25,040
- This is the real game now, everyone.
- This is real.

1418
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:26,140
It's real now.

1419
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,410
Everyone, please, show us what you have.

1420
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,510
Show what you have.

1421
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,180
One, two, three.

1422
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,580
LOVELYZ.

1423
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,820
<i>I LOVE YOU!!!!</i>

1424
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,860
- Good, good.
- Thank you.

1425
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,090
- The standing area, we can't lose.
- Shall we run to the front?

1426
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:42,560
- Shall we run?
- We will go to the seats.

1427
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,170
Then MiJoo and I will try to receive some responses here.

1428
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,600
Then Baby Soul and I will do it here.

1429
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:51,970
- Please, shout it loud.
- Hello~

1430
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,900
Can you hear it?

1431
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:58,000
- One... let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1432
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,780
- MiJoo, we'll start.
- Go on.

1433
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:00,710
Two, three.

1434
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:02,180
LOVELYZ.

1435
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:04,550
<i>I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!</i>

1436
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,850
The voice at the seating is louder.

1437
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:09,450
You are the best. You rule.

1438
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:11,120
- We won.
- Good job.

1439
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:11,860
They sounded similar.

1440
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:14,390
But LOVELINUS are one.

1441
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,330
- It's hard to choose the winner.
- How can we compare them?

1442
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:20,860
Everyone, how could we compare the
shouting of our LOVELINUS?

1443
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,570
Shall we go back to the main stage?

1444
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:28,710
- Lee SuJeong! Lee SuJeong! Lee SuJeong! Lee SuJeong!
- Why me?

1445
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:32,540
They want to see Baby Soul's aegyo.

1446
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:37,350
Both the seating and standing area were loud enough.

1447
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,850
- All the areas...
-Yes, they both were.

1448
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,490
So let's shout out...

1449
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:45,520
'LOVELINUS, we love you' all together.

1450
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,360
We will.

1451
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,030
Lee SuJeong! Lee SuJeong! Lee SuJeong!

1452
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,960
They want Soul's aegyo.

1453
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:58,640
Yesterday, each of us showed our charms
through LOVELYZ Diary.

1454
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:04,040
But since a lot of LOVELINUS want Baby Soul's aegyo,
she can go last.

1455
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,910
Okay, she can adorn the finale.

1456
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,680
We should say 'LOVELINUS, I love you',

1457
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,180
and it will start from JiSoo there.

1458
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:15,850
Since the message must be delivered
without being stopped,

1459
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:18,790
we will say 'LOVELINUS, I love you' endlessly.

1460
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:20,320
But Baby Soul will do it longer.

1461
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,090
Happy?

1462
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:25,330
- Starting from this side, right?
- Yes, from that side.

1463
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:29,030
You know the first runner
gets the most nervous.

1464
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,000
- This has to go on without any pause.
- You can do it.

1465
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,970
You can do it, JiSoo.

1466
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,910
Everyone, we won't have any pause between.

1467
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,210
We should do it fast.

1468
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,810
It will end in two shakes.

1469
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:40,810
- It'll be fast!
- You must cheer for us.

1470
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,680
On the count of one, two.

1471
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,950
One, two, three.

1472
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:47,850
LO.

1473
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,220
We are starting right now, right?

1474
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,660
- Yes, don't talk.
- Do it right way.

1475
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,820
- We must do it now.
- Again, again, again.

1476
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,660
There shouldn't be embarrassing pause.

1477
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,430
If you do it like that, we must start over.

1478
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,060
Let's do it in a relay then.

1479
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:03,530
I'll dot it, I'll dot it, I'll dot it.

1480
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:04,740
In a relay.

1481
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,700
- Fighting, JiSoo.
- Start from 'LO' again.

1482
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:09,170
Are you ready?

1483
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:11,140
One, two, three.

1484
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,110
LO.

1485
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,910
Wait, wait, I can't do it because the fans are screaming.

1486
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,180
- They can't hear my voice then.
- Everyone, everyone.

1487
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,580
It's so funny.

1488
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:20,680
Then, let's do it like this.

1489
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:23,520
- Scream after it's over.
- Yes, after it's over.

1490
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,100
Please, put back your voices for the moment.

1491
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,630
You get to scream after Baby Soul finishes it.

1492
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,830
Take in your breath, and scream after 'YOU'.

1493
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,730
Yes, yes. That is so.

1494
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:35,430
Let's do it again. It won't end this time.

1495
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,100
- Most of them are looking at jiSoo now.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

1496
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,100
What should I do?

1497
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:38,700
Good~

1498
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,840
I like it.

1499
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,270
G~o.

1500
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,440
I'll start!

1501
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,340
G~o!

1502
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,640
LO.

1503
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,180
VE.

1504
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,180
LY.

1505
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:48,940
Z

1506
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,010
NU.

1507
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,320
Isn't it LOVELINUS?

1508
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,220
It's NUS.

1509
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,890
It's LOVELINUS.

1510
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:56,790
What did you say?

1511
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:57,850
Ah, I'm sorry.

1512
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,120
I'm sorry that I'm stupid.

1513
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:00,920
Empty brains.

1514
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,660
- Kei, Kei.
- It's 'LOVELINUS I love you'.

1515
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,600
- You did it in purpose, right?
- To do it again.

1516
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,030
I thought it was 'LOVELYZ, I love you'.

1517
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:10,130
- One more time.
- Let's start again.

1518
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,200
Let's go, from the beginning.

1519
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,600
If this goes on, showing aegyo
becomes something easy.

1520
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,710
But you now what?
It's a pain for those who are waiting.

1521
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:17,410
I know, what should we do?

1522
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:18,710
What to do?

1523
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:19,680
What about me?

1524
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,850
- JiSoo will be in most pain.
- I'm so sorry.

1525
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:25,120
This will be the last for real, go.

1526
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:25,800
LO.

1527
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,450
VE.

1528
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,050
LI.

1529
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:27,850
NUS.

1530
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:28,590
S.

1531
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,220
I.

1532
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:29,890
LOVE.

1533
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,490
YOU.

1534
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,330
What was that?

1535
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:39,600
We'll sing our next song since we are embarrassed.

1536
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,370
I think we are ready.

1537
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:43,270
Are you ready to run?

1538
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:45,670
It's an exciting stage.

1539
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:49,570
- Let's run.
- Let's go!

01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:00,900
I want to be young! I'll be young!

1713
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,590
When you are eating something and I ask you for a bite,

1714
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:06,160
Sometimes you don't want to share.

1715
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:10,110
This is what I want to ask YeIn.

1716
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:11,850
When I ask her for a bit...

1717
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:13,650
Her eyes look very uncomfortable.

1718
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:15,270
We both don't want to share...

1719
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:17,370
But we both ask for a bite.

1720
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:19,000
You want to be the youngest member, right?

1721
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,800
Sometimes I want to be the youngest~

1722
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,470
But I want to be the eldest more.

1723
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:25,800
Seri! Ous! Ly!

1724
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,370
I'm not pretending to be nice... I'm serious!!!

1725
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:31,410
I just want to be a big sister to the younger members.

1726
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:36,340
I wonder why you always look for YeIn first...

1727
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:38,280
More than the other members!

1728
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,260
Other members make me feel comfortable too,

1729
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,860
But YeIn makes me... very calm.

1730
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,350
And she makes people comfortable when they are around her.

1731
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:47,690
[Then what did Baby Soul ask to YeIn?]
It's hard to say by myself.

1732
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:50,150
What did you eat to be so pretty?

1733
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:53,270
Is that a question?

1734
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:56,010
Ah~ Hold on~~

1735
01:46:56,010 --> 01:47:01,000
I think Baby Soul thinks I look pretty~

1736
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,530
Because I am the youngest member.

1737
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,990
She's pretty. I wonder what she eats.

1738
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:12,210
What did I say to JiAe?

1739
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:15,550
What hurts you the most now?

1740
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,500
Calling me Yoo JiAe.

1741
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,150
She doesn't call others by their full names.

1742
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,120
But she calls me...

1743
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,190
Yoo! JiAe...

1744
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,560
Why did you become a flower?

1745
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,170
You know the reason~

1746
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:27,390
You can see that I'm a flower.

1747
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,890
I'm sorry.

1748
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:30,330
I have a big smile.

1749
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:34,700
Should I say my face blooms? Just like a flower blooms.

1750
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:36,230
They say I smile like that.

1751
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:38,370
And everyone agreed to it.

1752
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,910
No one will know who Kei is if I'm with a flower~

1753
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:45,610
Who is Kei?

1754
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:50,250
Which two members will you take
if you have to go to a deserted island?

1755
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,480
Wow~ This is a killing question!

1756
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:56,620
I will take YeIn and JIN.

1757
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:58,890
The others...

1758
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:01,920
Are old now so I'll let them rest~

1759
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,390
Do you like cup noodles the most among all food?

1760
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,430
Because I always eat cup noodles?

1761
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:10,870
There are lots of food if I widen my world!

1762
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:12,740
What I can think of is only cup noodles~

1763
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,710
Yukgaejang The Love!

1764
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:18,710
You actually enjoy people making you show aegyo, right?

1765
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:20,410
Ah! No... Never~~ No.

1766
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,980
It's not nice to disappoint people so I just do it.

1767
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:26,000
I really hope that no one asks me to do aegyo!

1768
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,160
I don't avoid it these days.

1769
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:28,820
<i>Do aegyo!</i>

1770
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:29,500
No!!

1771
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:32,740
Was I avoiding it?

1772
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:35,310
Is your future dream still a fruit store?

1773
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:38,030
To be honest, it's changing a bit~

1774
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:42,810
I'm now twenty two and I think realistically...

1775
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:45,600
It might disappoint our fans.

1776
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,140
But it's getting a bit far from the fruit store.

1777
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:52,480
Soemtimes you pretend not to know
when you know you are pretty.

1778
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,140
Ah... but~

1779
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,060
I am trying so hard...

1780
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:00,000
To think that I'm pretty.

1781
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,090
But I don't think I am really that pretty.

1782
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:04,350
I don't know~

1783
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:08,160
I'm the best at this among LOVELYZ!

1784
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:09,690
My collarbone is pretty!

1785
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,640
I'm in charge of collarbones.

1786
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,030
I can fill water in my collarbones.

1787
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:14,730
I am a collarbone beauty.

1788
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:16,930
No~ I have the best collarbones~~~

1789
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:24,340
The eight girls talked honestly for the first time!

1790
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:26,980
I'm pissed off!

1791
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:27,720
This is how they get closer with each other once again~~!

1792
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,190
JiAe pisses off really often.

1793
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:30,310
I really didn't know.

1794
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:32,180
Why is she asking me that when she's not much different?

Those who are feeling hot, please, cool down
with the ice cream you got before.

Who got ice cream? Who did?

1861
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:46,500
I threw as hard as I could so that
they would reach the seats.

1862
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:47,600
- But it didn't reach far.
- I threw it like this.

1863
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:50,010
I also practiced very hard.

1864
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:53,010
To send it until the end, but it didn't make it.

1865
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:54,540
Did anyone at the seats receive one?

1866
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,050
I threw it to the seats.

1867
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:58,110
- There it is.
- He got it.

1868
01:53:58,110 --> 01:54:01,380
- Did someone get mine?
- I think we threw about half.

1869
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:07,160
Well, if you see that ice cream,
there are Poloraids pictures on it.

1870
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:09,060
- Poloraid?
- Polaroid.

1871
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:13,130
- She's having a hard time these days.
- There are polaroid pictures on it.

1872
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:16,430
And for today, there are also blank photos too.

1873
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:18,400
- Who got the blank photos today?
- Yes, there are blank photos.

1874
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,370
Please, look forward to it.

1875
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,970
As a new surprise,

1876
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:26,710
we gave you selfies during '1cm'

1877
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:29,210
and I hope you take good care of it.

1878
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,850
Everyone, how did you find the Truh Talk with LOVELYZ?

1879
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,050
Did you like it?

1880
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:42,990
We asked funny questions in order to
make LOVELINUS laugh. Right, YeIn?

1881
01:54:42,990 --> 01:54:46,800
I didn't mean a single thing that I asked.

1882
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,200
That sounds like a total lie.

1883
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,930
Whenever you offered me food,

1884
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,540
you always made me want to eat it so much!

1885
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:55,800
It's true, it's true.

1886
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,540
One bite is always the most delicious part.

1887
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:59,940
One bite of ramen is the best.

1888
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,610
Ramen is delicious.

1889
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:04,010
You like ramen.

1890
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:06,780
- Cup noodles are so good.
- MiJoo likes cup noodles.

1891
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,920
- She really dos.
- Yes, she does.

1892
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,020
Everyone knows.

1893
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:13,290
Yukgaejang, Yukgaejang!

1894
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:15,190
Didn't you eat it today?

1895
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,730
I ate it today morning.

1896
01:55:18,090 --> 01:55:20,160
- And you ate it yesterday too.
- It's good, I ate it yesterday too.

1897
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,500
You should film an advertisement.

1898
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,870
I wasn't on the video,

1899
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:29,310
if there's something I'd like to ask, I want to ask JIN.

1900
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:30,000
What is it?

1901
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,210
I am so curious about what you dream when you sleep.

1902
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:34,780
Do you know why, everyone?

1903
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:40,050
Our JIN talks in her sleep and it's so spectacle.

1904
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,450
I am the witness, everyone.

1905
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:46,890
So I really want to know what
she dreams in her sleep.

1906
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:47,590
Me?

1907
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:50,560
I usually don't dream.

1908
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,960
But recently, I just...

1909
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:56,380
Dreamed of someone I saw on that day.

1910
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:58,430
JiSoo and I share the same room.

1911
01:55:58,430 --> 01:56:00,600
And you said that you heard something.

1912
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,970
She really talks a lot in her sleep.

1913
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:09,510
And it sounds like as if she is uttering a spell.

1914
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:13,220
She talks cutely in her sleep.

1915
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:14,880
It's cute, nothing special.

1916
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:16,820
Yes, she's a baby.

1917
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:19,120
- Baby JIN.
- A 22 years old baby?

1918
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:27,460
- LOVELINUS are my friends.
- Yes, it is.

1919
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:31,530
The next stage will be our new song.

1920
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:35,440
The tittle of the song is 'Fallin''.

1921
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:41,810
And the lyrics are what we want to say to LOVELINUS.

1922
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:43,710

How was our song?

02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,650
Did you feel our heart?

1968
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:43,320
<i>Yes!!!</i>

1969
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:46,890
- Thank you.
- Falling in LOVELYZ.

1970
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:48,020
You speak good english.

1971
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:48,960
They said 'Falling in LOVELYZ'.

1972
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:53,230
Did you see the lyrics on the screen while we were singing?

1973
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,230
<i>Yes.</i>

1974
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,170
We wrote every letter ourselves.

1975
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:03,870
Fallin' which we sang for the first time in this concert,

1976
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:09,540
was given from composer Marco who
worked with us for the first time.

1977
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:12,980
It's a song that expressed a farewell beautifully.

1978
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:18,950
Just like LOVELYZ and LOVELINUS are in love?

1979
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:20,790
- Ah, I'm so shy.
- Yes, right.

1980
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:24,690
The song released today is our new song.

1981
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:29,530
But it might be included in our new album,
so please look forward to it.

1982
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,500
Well, everyone.

1983
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:38,710
LOVELYZ and LOVELINUS
always think about eachother.

1984
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:41,010
But still, time flies so fast.

1985
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:41,910
That's true.

1986
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:42,810
What should we do?

1987
02:01:42,810 --> 02:01:44,210
- That's right.
- Why?

1988
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:45,250
What should we do?

1989
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:46,780
It's because the concert is going to end up soon.

1990
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:48,080
We have 3 songs left.

1991
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,850
Really?

1992
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:50,350
I don't want to go.

1993
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:51,420
Nope!

1994
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:55,390
Shall we hold an all-night concert
next time just like SuJeong said?

1995
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:56,730
<i>Yes!!!</i>

1996
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,830
Will it be fine?

1997
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:04,330
It's such a pity, but if there's farewell,
there's also a next meeting.

1998
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:08,500
Shall we thank some people
before we say goodbye?

1999
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,340
Shall we?

2000
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,840
I'll go first.

2001
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,810
Our Woollim family!

2002
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:18,250
Executive producer Lee JoongYeop, chairman
Honseok and including the management family.

2003
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:20,220
I am really thankful.

2004
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:23,320
JiYoung, our choreography instructor.

2005
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,250
Who spent nights with us for every new song.

2006
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,250
JiYoung, who stay up all night with us.

2007
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:33,230
And also thank you to our
hair stylists and make-up artists

2008
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:36,570
Who made us look beautiful.

2009
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:38,800
And also to the stylist staffs...

2010
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:42,740
And Interpark, production music,

2011
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:47,380
sound, light and video directors, thank you.

2012
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:54,420
And thank you to Mr. Jin Soo PD
who filmed the LOVELYZ Diary 4.5 VCR.

2013
02:02:54,420 --> 02:03:00,990
And thank you so much to INFINITE's SungGyu
and SungYeol who came to watch our concert.

2014
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:02,420
Thank you.

2015
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,100
The best! Sunbaenims, you're the best!

2016
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:08,230
And there are people who made summer
concert 'ALWAYZ' shine more.

2017
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:13,240
We will introduce you our LOVELYZ band
who made live performances possible.

2018
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,870
Song-Gi for base.

2019
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:19,570
Don't play the same thing as yesterday.

2020
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:22,140
Ah, he's so cool.

2021
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,050
- He's cool.
- Thank you.

2022
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,590
And next.

2023
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:36,220
